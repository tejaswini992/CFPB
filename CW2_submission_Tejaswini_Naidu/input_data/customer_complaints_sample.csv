1761722,2021-08-03,Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I have an account with Comenity XXXX XXXX, by virtue of a purchase I made at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX ( XXXX ). 

In XXXX I submitted a payment which was mailed timely and processed late. The check I submitted in payment for XXXX in the amount of {$130.00}, dated XX/XX/XXXX. That was 4 days prior to the due date. I have no image since it seems Comenitys practice is to not return negotiated checks to the bank. The next statement indicated Comenity processed the check on XX/XX/XXXX, and the transaction hit my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. Comenity asserts it was received late which I dispute. 

I sent a letter to the CFO of Comenity expressing my dispute dated XX/XX/XXXX, after being stonewalled by two reps of Comenity. I received no response. I sent a second letter disputing the assessment of late fees on XX/XX/XXXX, with a payment of the full outstanding balance of the loan from the purchase, as indicated on the billing statement. That amount was {$5300.00}. 

This payment was recorded on the subsequent statement. 

I received a letter from Comenity dated XX/XX/XXXX, in response to complaints filed with CFPB and XXXX. This letter was 44 days after the date of my initial letter. Prior to that date I received no letter from Comenity in response to my letters sent directly to them. I did receive a letter from Comenity dated XX/XX/XXXX concerning my dispute, which I presume was in response to my letter to their CFO. No dispute ID was shown in the letter. The response merely stated the issue was under investigation. The response time for both exceeds that permitted under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

The Comenity response to XXXX  and CFPB was that the account was reviewed and was deemed correct. No other explanation or supporting documentation was provided. 
The FCBA stipulates that I may withhold payment on the disputed amount ( and related charges ) during the investigation. "" You must pay any part of the bill not in question, including finance charges on the undisputed amount. '' I paid undisputed charges, finally paying off the note. Comenity continued to assess late fees and interest, contrary to the FCBA.

The FCBA also states the creditor may not take any legal or other action to collect the disputed amount and related charges ( including finance charges ) during the investigation. Comenity continued to assess interest and charges during the pendency of the dispute. Moreover, when I submitted my payment to discharge the loan, rather than adhering to my clear instructions, Comenity applied part of that payment to the disputed interest and fees, contrary to the FCBA. 

I responded to the Comenity letter of XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, continuing to assert my dispute and presenting them with what I assert are factual errors on their part. Comenity historically processed payments within 4 days, which was also the time for my XXXX payment. Comenity began processing considerably longer than other credit companies I do business with in XXXX and after, and which has degraded in the time period shown. 

I assert the issue with the payment processing is due to internal problems that Comenity is experiencing, probably related to Covid, particularly staffing shortages experienced by other companies. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another letter to Comenity objecting to their XX/XX/XXXX letter and assertion that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was made timely. The XXXX payment timeliness was never in dispute. Comenity ignored my rebuttal to their previous letters. In my XX/XX/XXXX letter I asserted my rights under the FCBA, including wanting documentation in support of their assertions, and advising them of their violations of the FCBA, and finally putting them on notice concerning reporting to credit agencies.

The FCBA states that any creditor who fails to follow the settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any related finance charges, up to {$50.00}, even if the bill turns out to be correct. I assert that in several areas Comenity has failed to adhere to the law. However the {$50.00} cap is meaningless in the context of Comenity continuing to assess late charges and interest, which is as coercive as it is wrong. 

Given the other matters of this dispute, I fully expect Comenity to ignore the {$50.00} carve out, as they have ignored my dispute in general. This is not surprising when viewed in context with reports of class action suits against Comenity and a litany of complaints shown in the XXXX  and CFPB records. There are also a long list of complaints on the Comenity XXXX page. 

A Class action lawsuit filed on XX/XX/XXXX in United States District Court, Central District of California, Southern Division, against Comenity Bank, alleges improper debt collection practices. 

Class action suits alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act were filed in XXXX, and XXXX. In XXXX the company settled a class action suit filed under the TCPA for {$8.00} XXXX. This XXXX lawsuit was settled shortly after it was filed. Suits have also been filed against Comenity Bank for violations of the TCPA in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and California. 

The XXXX  reports Comenity reviews of 1.04/5, which is very consistent with my experience. The specific reviews are abysmal. What is troubling is that my own review which I submitted a few days ago does not show up. The XXXX  gives Comenity a F rating and the company is not XXXX  accredited. 

I examined the XXXX  complaints shown on the web site and Comenity consistently responds with, We appreciate you taking the time to let us know you have concerns. We will begin researching immediately and will contact you when our investigation is complete. 

There is no evidence that any resolution occurred. Moreover, the complaint I submitted, in some detail, is not even shown. 

I examined reviews on ConsumerAffairs. Comenity has a rating of 3.5/5, but looking at the actual reviews in the last 12 months I only found one good one. Most of the rest were rated 1. 

In XXXX the FDIC announced settlement with Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank for Deceptive Practices. 

It is clear that Comenity is a bad actor. This is my second complaint to CFPB. CFPB merely accepted the initial Comenity response at face value and dropped the matter. I submitted an extensive rebuttal, but I can not find it anywhere on the CFPB site. How can consumers be warned about bad business practices if the information is not provided? This complaint concerns not only the original issue of Comenity improperly assessing late fees and interest, but also for violations of the Fair Credit Billing Act. 

I request that you contact Comenity and require them to discontinue their usurious practices, remove all assessed fees and interest, refund the amount I paid under duress and under protest, and close the account as I have requested.",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",NM,87124,,Consent provided,Web,2021-08-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4600079

I then realized I would need more and uploaded {$10.00} at XXXX. While using the in-app boost merchant website the app kept freezing so I had to start my purchase again. While shopping I received a text from CashApp at XXXX stating a transaction from XX/XX/XXXX, from the current merchant I am now shopping at, has been updated to {$43.00}. When my purchase went through, I was notified from CashApp text at XXXX that I had insufficient funds. Now the times I am giving are from the texts, and activity screen of app and msg. The times have a major discrepancy from in app and online activity, and text msg notification. The text and activity went through at the same time, yet somehow the times vary differently from the other. I dont personally know the actual time this took place outside of the msg text, and in app activity is telling me. The in-app activity for CashApp varies an hour in difference from the mobile site and the online site. Either the times in app or online are an hour ahead or behind. Based on the time of the msg text notification, the mobile app activity is an hour behind, and online app activity is the same time frame of msg text. My Bank statement from my checkings account, which my debit card of this bank account is tied to my CashApp account, is stating in the online activity of bank account that the transfer of funds from my account to CashApp, of which I was personally transferring to CashApp in app of CashApp for my purchase, was transferred on XX/XX/XXXX to CashApp despite making the transfer the day before on the XXXX of XXXX. It seems the funds didn't transfer to CashApp until the next day from my Checkings account the day after my complaint to CashApp. 

On XX/XX/XXXX according to in app support log at XXXX I contacted support about the issue that Ive come to. After my notification of insufficient funds for purchase, I look at my in app CashApp balance, and only see an amount of {$16.00}. After telling support of having {$60.00} in my account and now only have {$16.00} they asked me in what payment I was having issues with, and gave me an option to show them, which I did. They proceed to answer by telling me that I had insufficient funds, and how to resolve this, while completely ignoring my original concern. So, I reiterate my issue again. Told them to look at my history and showed them the text notification that I received. They asked me to attach the amounts I uploaded, and I did. They proceed to tell me a technical error that occurred between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, impacted one or more of my cash card transactions. During this time merchants that I used my cash card with successfully received payment, but the funds were not deducted from my account. As a result, my balance was temporarily higher than it should have been because my purchase to the merchant did not decrease my balance. The balance Im seeing now, reflects the amount they deducted to recover these funds, and successfully complete the payment. I then asked why I was never informed this was happening? They proceed to answer by saying ; They can confirm that an impacted transaction due to error occurring again reiterating the dates given previous and proceeded to repeat information already given with the added ; The funds deducted were the funds I previously used to make a payment with said merchant, but which were then incorrectly returned to my account due to a technical error. They then tell me I can view my transaction in app and online in the activity tab. 

I looked in my activity tab to find the error they spoke of, but there was nothing which I told them, and asked is if theres a history, I can view the errors because the history I have says payment completed? I then ask AGAIN, why wasnt I ever notified this was occurring? They respond with the name of the merchant, and date/time of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX for {$42.00}. I tell them I have no payment history for that date and time. They tell me theyll reach out directly to their specialty team so they can help me with this, and ask for my email, of which I give. A few hours later I ask support when I can expect the specialist email. I get a bot response of nothing instead not answering my concern. I then ask the next day at XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. They tell me they have escalated my case, and once the team has an update, theyll email me. They then give me a case number. I have yet to hear from them. My concern is the way they seemed to resolve this issue of balance owed, and the information given to me, or lack thereof. I have no error reports of any kind for me to view from the app, email, or text notifications I have. I am only having their word any of this was happening, and even if true, I was still never given a warning, or notified any of these errors were occurring by CashApp in the first place. I seemingly am being punished for something they didnt help me to see beforehand. I am on disability and try to budget my spending. This tore into that without warning and impacted me negatively. This situation has exhausted me mentally, and emotionally. I have been re traumatized from this action, and have not been given clear answers, or solution. They continue to hold onto my funds they have taken. I have done everything on my end to my knowledge for this to not have occurred as the consumer. There was nothing this company has done to protect me from their errors.

Was tol by XXXX agent that once a check has cleared there is no way for it to then be rejected or returned. This was XXXX Case # XXXX ~ XX/XX/22 Called Cap 1 to tell them the payment had cleared XXXX and not returned. They connected a XXXX agent for a 3 way conversation. The XXXX agent re-iterated that the payment had cleared XXXX on XX/XX/22 and had not been returned to Cap 1. I was told that the 2 banks would investigate and resolve. 
XX/XX/22 Called XXXX  to, once again, try to resolve the issue. The XXXX agent got a Cap 1 agent, XXXX, on the phone. The Cap 1 agent stated, again, that XXXX returned the payment, now for Stop Payment. This was never the case. The XXXX agent requested, 3 times, a Cap 1 case number from XXXX and was told, 3 times, that they did not assign case numbers. The XXXX agent then verified a fax number and department where a copy of the check deposited by Cap 1 had cleared XXXX. 
XX/XX/22 Called Cap 1 to verify they received the fax and were investigating. ( The very first question was what is your case number ) I asked to speak to a supervisor and once again explained the situation and that they had the proof of payment from XXXX somewhere at Cap 1 as the fax had been verified as received by XXXX. Given Cap 1 case Number XXXX XX/XX/22 The payment of {$75.00} had been credited to my account, but then had, once again, been debited out. 
XX/XX/22 Called Cap 1 to see if the problem had been resolved. It had not, so requested to speak to a manager, someone in charge who could investigate the problem. I was transferred to a gentleman who said he was requesting further investigation from the back office. 
XX/XX/22 Cap 1 sent me a letter stating they could not resubmit a returned payment and I would need to make a new payment of {$75.00}. That bears no resemblance to the issue at hand as I, nor anyone else, had asked them to resubmit the payment. 

Please note that in all of this, it appears to be an issue at Capital One as my account at XXXX XXXX has never been credited back the {$75.00} originally debited on XX/XX/22. Capital One has been asked several times to show proof that XXXX XXXX had returned the payment and has never done so.

This was untrue and never heard from Wells Fargo until I received a loan modification the end of XX/XX/XXXX. I was then given a specialist { XXXX XXXX } to call with any questions. I tried for days and weeks and never got thru to her because she was either not answering or her voicemail was full and you couldn't leave one. I decided to call and get a rep on the phone and explained to him I had questions about the loan mod and had absolutely no help getting in touch with my rep. I asked for a supervisor to please contact me. XXXX XXXX called me which was a supervisor and went over the terms of the mod with me and at that point in the state in which I reside a program was offered called XXXX to families to help pay back mortgage payments and it would go live on XX/XX/XXXX. I had told XXXX that I would like to try to get help thru XXXX to pay my back balance off and that would allow me to do a refinance and lower my monthly mortgage payment because when Wells Fargo did the loan mod they only lowered my payment by XXXX. XXXX said he would put my account on a hold until I could get everything over to XXXX and get the ball rolling. If I were to do the loan mod thru Wells Fargo it wouldn't offer a refinance until you were 6months to a year in to your mod. He then gave me his direct line and said to contact him with any updates. Once I had submitted my info to XXXX XXXX had tried several times to contact him and nothing. Again I called to speak to a rep who could get me in touch with either a supervisor or XXXX. I then had a call two days later from XXXX which was a supervisor as well. At that point Wells Fargo said my loan mod was no longer being offered when she pulled up the information on it. I had told her what was going on and she had told me she was going to expedite my loan on to a reopening team to see if they could get it reinstated. She would call me back with any questions. I received one call from her letting me know if I needed anything to call her. That was on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then I have not received any call from her, just letters from XXXX XXXX telling me they need documents for a loan mod and to call her. I call and here we are again ... .no answer and a full mailbox. I then called back to try to get XXXX on the phone and no luck.

This is not an error on my end, this is an error by TransUnion personnel that can be easily fixed by looking at the rest of my file for reference. I was also told some creditor I have never heard of spelled my name incorrectly, and thats the reason why its currently misspelled. This doesnt make sense, as how can a creditor I have never heard of change the spelling of my first name with a credit agency? Not only that, TransUnion knows as well as I do that I have zero debt and zero creditors. They can clearly see this reflected in my file, and I know this to be a fact, so how can a creditor change my name? The agent, XXXX XXXX, told me I would have to mail TransUnion various paperwork in order to prove my identity, and that is when I asked to speak to a supervisor. When I was transferred to a supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, he told me he would need all my information again because it did not transfer with the call. Needless to say I was not amused and refused to give any further information. I was told to call an XXXX number and ask to speak directly with a supervisor in special management handling in the USA. At this time I have not been able to get a temporary lift on the security freeze for my employer background check, and will have to prove my identity by sending in various personal identifications to correct a mistake made by TransUnion.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,119XX,,Consent provided,Web,2021-06-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4429762

This is clearly advertised as an insurance on cancellations but they will not honor this. 

XXXX I called AMEX to confirm my flights in XXXX to XXXX and ask about covid precautions, PCRs, etc. I was told that the airport, date and duration of my return flight had changed, but no one had informed me until then. My return flight went from a duration of 13hrs to 38hrs, including an overnight lay over I didn't plan, and I was then told I would have to pay if I wanted a better flight or fly from my original selection. I was also told I would have to pay for a bus to the new departure airport. I refused to agree to this as none of this was my fault nor was I informed and I was then transferred to the AMEX Platinum insurance dept, XXXX XXXX, as they said my card covers travel cancelations interruptions like this. An automated service said there would be a 5min wait and I was on hold for 35mins, then the phone was hung up on. When I called AMEX Travel back I was told this department closed at XXXXEST while I was on hold. I asked to speak with a supervisor who then told me the XXXX XXXX XXXX. isn't even open on the weekends. At the same time I was on the Online Chat service and I was told the Ins dept. was open until XXXX and was given a direct number to call that didn't work. 

I asked the supervisor I was speaking to on the phone to send me information to make a formal complaint as I was receiving 3 different stories form 4 different AMEX staff members and I was told there was no further person to contact and there was nothing more I could do. I spent 3 hours on the phone to be told there is no one working that could help me and I have to call the insurance dept. on Monday. 

XXXX - After a further 3 hrs of calls and holding today, XXXX informed me that they do not cover Trip Cancellation and Interruption, except in some very rare circumstances, Airline cancelation is not one of them. I told the representative that this is also not listed in section F of the contract under what is not covered. The XXXX Representatives agreed this is misleading advertised and acknowledged the exclusion was missing from the contract. They also admitted they receive this complaint regularly, they recorded the conversation so this can be confirmed. 

Bottom line, I pay hundreds of dollars for an AMEX Platinum service that is not provided as advertised. I spoke with 9 different people in total and was lied to on several occasions, hung up on 3 times and the worst part is I wouldnt even be aware of the flight change if I hadn't contact AMEX myself and would have had to sleep in an airport as nothing is available at this point in time.",,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,CA,94607,,Consent provided,Web,2021-06-28,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,4499917

2. Reason for dispute : Fraud I do not recognize these transactions and never authorized any of the charges above. I received a letter in the mail on XX/XX/2022 stating that Citi never received the information needed, and Citi had to continue the investigation with the information available. Citi said unfortunately, there wasn't a response from me and the investigation would not result in my favor. I originally disputed all of these charges on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent Citi information on XX/XX/2022 via the email account that was provided to me. I also requested full documentation of this investigation. I was never provided with any of this information. I was charged late fees during these disputes, as well. Then all conditional credits were reversed. I plan on exercising my credit card user rights and contacting the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding the malpractice conducted in this investiagtion. Pursuant to XXXX Reason Code XXXX. Any creditor who fails to follow the settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any related finance charges, up to {$50.00}, even if the bill turns out to be correct. I refuse to pay for any of the unauthorized charges. Also, both accounts can be closed if this does not get resolved.

3. Request Please credit the full amount to my account, all late fees removed, an accurate statement, all documentation regarding the investigation, and an open case against the merchant.

See letter below. Listed above and below are all the disputes that shouldve been under investigation since XX/XX/XXXX. Citi is not following the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

The card issuer has 30 days to acknowledge receipt of a complaint. Some of the disputes were never acknowledged at all. I disputed ALL charges in the letter below in XXXX. Some of them were acknowledged and some of them were not. Its way past the 30-day time period.

The card issuer has two billing cycles to complete their investigation. Two billing cycles have come and gone. During that time the issuer is not allowed to try to collect the payment, charge interest on it, or report it to credit bureaus as late. Citi has charged interest, late fees, and tried to collect payment. Also, Citi has reported me to the credit bureaus for being late with payment. 

If the card issuer finds that the disputed payment was invalid, it must correct the error and refund any fees or interest charged as a result. If it finds there was no error, it must explain its findings and, upon request, provide documentation to back them up. I have requested all documentation of these investigations. I have not received documentation to back up any decisions made my Citi.

Any creditor who fails to follow the settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any related finance charges, up to {$50.00}, even if the bill turns out to be correct. For example, if a creditor acknowledges your complaint in 45 days 15 days too late. I will NEVER pay this. I will continue to dispute the charges online, like I did yesterday. I expect these charges to be off my account. Please credit my account. I will be filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Protection Bureau, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX

Our total payment went up by over {$100.00} due to increased escrow requirements. We have automatic payments set up from our bank. We did not update the automatic payment settings in time and a bill payment check was sent to Citizens Bank. We realized the shortage and called their service center to make a phone payment so we would not be short on the payment or delinquent due to a short payment. They refused to take a partial payment over the phone. They told us we needed to wait for the bank check to post as a short payment. Then we can call them to make another payment. But if it is short we get a fee.

It may be late as well if we don't get the timing right. I worked as a loan officer and for a financial institution processing company for years. I know that a partial payment can be taken and should be posted as directed by the payor if it is in excess of a payment. If less, then it can be posted as defined in the disclosure. I am fine with that process. However, to not even allow the partial payment so that the consumer risks late or insufficient payment fees is not a consumer friendly policy. This is the type of activity that caused the whole CARD act in the first place. 

All we wanted was to make a simple payment to avoid fees. Citizens evidently wants us to get every fee possible and confuse consumers. I just feel fortunate that I understand what really should occur and how to address the issue with the appropriate authorities. BTW the managing service rep agreed that the process was an issue and had other customers complain about Citizens not taking partial payments and applying them to the amount due. 

I asked what would happen if I sent 3 checks on different days. She said they would hold them in suspense until there was enough to make the full payment due. Or sometimes they return the checks. I find that last one completely unlikely but then again it would add fees and interest for the bank. 

Just need to know that consumers have some right to do the right thing without having to jump through hoops and then hope they might get it right.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",MO,650XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2023-03-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6675066

Please ref account known as XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a federal judge found Wells Fargo Bank is in breach of a XXXX nationwide mortgage loan class action settlement involving adjustable payments for home mortgages, since the bank allegedly did not properly evaluate homeowners who applied for these types of loan payments in order to avoid foreclosure. 
U.S. District Judge XXXX XXXX asked Wells Fargo to meet with the plaintiffs in order to find a new way to fix the mortgage loan class action settlement violations, which will need to include steps that will allow homeowners to reapply for loan assistance through Wells Fargo Bank. 
Judge XXXX decision is just the most recent of a long list of disputes regarding the XXXX Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action settlement, an agreement which resolved several complaints related to the banks pick-a-payment loans, many of which were acquired by Wells Fargo during their XXXX acquisition of Wachovia Corp . 
These pick-a-payment loans allowed borrowers to initially pay less interest than was due on their mortgage ; however, the escalating payments that came later as a result of these types of mortgage loans contributed to the thousands of home foreclosures that occurred during the countrys XXXX housing crisis. For years the plaintiffs legal representatives argued Wells Fargo was in violation of the Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action settlement agreement, in that the bank was not granting loan modifications that would have been worth {$2.00} billion to homeowners with Wells Fargo pick-a-payment mortgage loans. These modifications were an integral part of the Wells Fargo mortgage loan settlement agreement, which also stipulated the bank would pay {$50.00} million to eligible Class Members. 
However, according to the plaintiffs new Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action lawsuit, the bank was not using proper methodologies to evaluate whether or not a homeowner was at risk of imminent default, which would have qualified them for loan assistance under the previous Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action settlement. 
The plaintiffs legal representatives in this mortgage loan class action lawsuit allege thousands of homeowners were denied the mortgage assistance due to them because Wells Fargo Bank used faulty methods to measure their financial hardships pertaining to the pick-a-payment home loans. 
In his recent ruling, Judge XXXX reprimanded both sides of this Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action lawsuit, stating that it seemed that neither side knew exactly what they agreed to more than four years ago, during the initial Wells Fargo mortgage loan class action settlement. However, the judge agreed with the plaintiffs arguments that the bank breached the settlement agreement by using evolving and ill-defined standards when determining homeowners loan modification applications. 
The court has ordered that both Wells Fargo and the suing plaintiffs present a joint or competing proposals to correct the mortgage loan class action settlement violations to be submitted within the next two weeks.

I use Fifth Third 's Bill Pay Service regularly. One of my accounts registered within bill pay is XXXXXXXX XXXX. 

I scheduled a {$2000.00} payment to be made to XXXXXXXX XXXXk through Fifth Third 's Bill Pay product. Instead of Fifth Third sending the {$2000.00} payment to XXXX XXXX, they sent the payment to XXXX XXXX. I do not have XXXXXXXX XXXX  listed on my bill pay service through Fifth Third. I don't know where they got the info to send the payment to XXXXXXXX XXXX 

When I saw on my account that a {$2000.00} payment had been sent to XXXX XXXX I called Fifth Third and asked them to make the correction as this was their error. They said there was nothing they could do and I had to call XXXXXXXX XXXX  and figure it out on my own. This error was clearly the fault of Fifth Third and they should have rectified their error. They refused to do so. 

I just spent the last hour on the phone with XXXX XXXX to attempt to get the {$2000.00} payment mailed back to me. They explained the misapplied payment has to go back to Fifth Third electronically and then to my account the same way it came out. 

I do not trust Fifth Third to redeposit the {$2000.00} back to my account when they receive it from XXXX XXXX. Please conduct an in-depth audit on how Fifth Third does business, how this horrendous error could have occurred, and why they require the consumer to rectify their errors. {$2000.00} might not be a lot of money to some people but it is to me. 

Fine Fifth Third substantially if you can, and require them to rectify their own errors instead of having the consumer take off work to fix Fifth Third 's mistakes. In addition, please require them to immediately redeposit the {$2000.00} back into my account.

446851,2023-03-18,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with fees charged,"I submitted a complaint on XX/XX/XXXX regarding Bank of the Wests handling of the loan processing for a motorhome I purchased from an individual. I stated I purchased the motorhome around the end of XXXX or first of XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of the West responded by saying this was incorrect as I signed the installment agreement on XX/XX/XXXX. This may be a matter of opinion but the first of XXXX was not a specific date but a statement of the general timeframe. The date the loan was funded is irrelevant and not in dispute. The handling of the process from that point forward including the response to my original complaint is unacceptable. The loan was funded in XXXX of XXXX and the transfer of title/registration was not completed until XX/XX/XXXX. This was not because of a power of attorney that was submitted incorrectly. Paperwork was requested before the loan was actually funded as well as the title that was sent to the previous owner. The previous owner made copies of all paperwork and the original title before sending to Bank of the West in a return envelope they provided. I was told on one of the many customer service calls that I made it appeared the paperwork was lost by Bank of the West because the loan had not yet been funded and therefore had no where to go as they could not match the paperwork with an existing account. This is only one example of the gross negligence and incompetency of Bank of the West. We were sent paperwork to take to the DMV to have the VIN certified and we were told we had to take the motorhome to the DMV to do this. We drove 30 minutes away on 2 separate days after getting an appointment at the DMV only to be told the motorhome was titled in CA originally and did not need any other certification from the DMV to move forward. According to the DMV that process is only for vehicles that were not previously titled in the state of CA. I took time off from work to take care of this unnecessary request. As a bank processing loans in the state of CA someone should have known the process before requesting paperwork that wasnt needed. I called regarding this XXXX up as well. There are numerous documented phone calls from myself and my wife attempting to get some sort of action on this process. Each time we called we were given a different reason for the delay. At no point did anyone from Bank of the West inform me the delay was a result of incorrect paperwork. We even provided documentation requested through email and still did not receive a response. This process was delayed over the course of 9 months through no fault of our own and is a direct result of the mishandling and improper practices of Bank of the West. I do not dispute that a retail installment contract was signed or the responsibility to pay. I dispute the statement from Bank of the West that they will not reimburse me for payments made on a motorhome that I was unable to use or move because of their negligence. I do not dispute that insurance is required. I dispute the response by Bank of the West that they should not have to reimburse any part of payments made even though I was not able to drive the motorhome through their negligence. If Bank of the West actually looked into this matter as they claimed then they would have found records of the numerous phone calls that were made by myself and my wife trying to rectify this situation. I even went in person to the local Bank of the West in XXXX, Ca and still could not get anyone to help me. I can assure you if we were told a power of attorney was the only thing needed it would have been provided right away. The original registration expired during this long and tedious process preventing us from using the motorhome in any capacity. Once again I can assure you if we had been able to fix the issue as simply as providing the POA we would have done so. Instead we had to continually make payments for something that we did not legally own. The title as well as the registration remained in the previous owners name and therefore Bank of the West was collecting payments for a loan that they never completely processed. The registration was finally received XX/XX/XXXX and instead of a normal registration period it only covers the remaining months of the original registration. So not only could I not drive or use the motorhome now i will have to pay for the renewal in a matter of a few months instead of the year we should have received. At the very least the late fees as well as the fee for the shortened renewal should have been covered by Bank of the West. Instead the only resolution offered was to review the bills I received for the 2 storage spots I was forced to pay for as I was unable to move the motorhome to the closer storage facility with expired registration. I respectfully decline to take your ludicrous response to a very valid complaint at face value. Nothing in this process was a result of my negligence or failure to provide requested or accurate documentation. Everything related to this is a direct result of the incompetence of Bank of the West. They should be ashamed at the way they treat hard working people who are the whole reason they can conduct business in the first place.

1737874,2021-12-13,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with balance transfer,"On XX/XX/2021, I took advantage of a balance transfer offer from Capital One. I transferred {$9800.00} and was assessed a balance transfer fee of {$190.00}. I didn't receive this {$9800.00}. I called to check on it a week later as it had been deducted from the card even though I hadn't received it. The representative I spoke to didn't understand I hadn't received it it, just continued talking about what the offer was. She finally got me to a superior, who upon looking into it told me a check had been mailed ( rather than a direct transfer into the account ). I cancelled the balance transfer. This was on XX/XX/2021. They removed the balance transfer but not the {$190.00} fee. The agent told me it would take a billing cycle for the fee to be removed. I spent nearly and hour on the phone getting this taking care of. 

It is now XX/XX/2021. The {$190.00} fee has still not been removed. So I called customer service again, only to get caught up in some medical alert advertisement. Twice. So I called technical online support in order to access customer service somehow. The agent there researched this for a period of time and then sent me over to a transactions department, who needed all this information again. Then, upon her researching it, she acted as if the fee were supposed to be assessed. I finally got through to her that I had reversed the balance transfer. She had me on the phone over half an hour looking into this and discussing it with an "" account specialist. '' Then she transferred me over to an account specialist! It turns out she couldn't do anything herself and simply wasted my time. The account specialist went over this, for a third time, with me, and is right now having me on hold as she, well, I don't know what she's going to do. I am writing while having to wait on hold, now nearly an hour into this call. 

Well actually, they have just now hung up on me. Probably not intentionally, but they have not called me back. This means I'm going to have to call and go through this whole hour plus process again just to get money they are supposed to have automatically returned to me. And risk the same thing happening again... 

Clearly Capital One had nothing in place to remove this balance transfer fee. It was not going to happen automatically. They were quite content to keep {$190.00} that was not theirs. This balance transfer fee refund should have happened immediately. ( Had I cashed that check, which I destroyed as promised, they could have immediately reassesed the {$190.00}. ) Instead, I have had to call to get a series of runarounds and put significant energy and effort into getting back money that I do not owe. 

This has gone from feeling like a series of mistakes to intentional fraud. I'm not sure how they're allowed to get away with this. Capital One still has {$190.00} of my money that does not belong to them. I have no idea what it is going to take to be successful in having it returned to me. How are they allowed to do this? Is this not akin to theft or fraud?",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,NM,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2021-12-13,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,5002185

The bond value was {$5900.00} Prior to the lease renewal, I reached out to XXXX XXXX in repeated emails over the course of a least a month asking to be removed from the lease. All my emails were received and acknowledged. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a "" Lease Amendment to Remove a Resident '' fully executed ( signed by XXXX XXXX as agent for the owner removing me from the lease as of XX/XX/XXXX and released from "" further liability under the Rental Agreement ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I inquired by email with XXXX whether the bond could be transferred. I was told that it not only could NOT be transferred, but they were not issuing any more bonds due to Covid. I told them I was moving out and provided them with the documentation specifically the amendment to the lease to remove a tenant among other emails documenting my moving and cancelling. I also made sure in several emails that the bond was cancelled and was not to be renewed. Their response in an email was "" the bond purchased in your "" my name '' will no longer be valid once you move out ''. 

I then notified XXXX XXXX via emails that the bond was cancelled and that they no longer had a security deposit. In an email on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX, I said that I had "" a surety bond in my name that I am cancelling so please do whatever inspections/replacement of the surety bond that needs to be done '' I reiterated that I had moved out and thus the bond would not be valid per JXXXX email. 

This email was acknowledged and replied to. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was copied on an email from the property manager XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX to the owner of the home that I had formerly leased. I believe I was accidentally copied on the email. In that email, XXXX XXXX clearly says "" the recent lease signed only includes XXXX XXXX as a resident and no pets ''. 

I never received any notices from XXXX XXXX on anything about the house ( unpaid rent, damages or anything ) and never even thought about it until I received a notification from credit monitoring that there was a collection account added. Needless to say, I was shocked. XXXX XXXX clearly had all my contact info and never once reached out to me stating there was a problem. 

I have been told by XXXX XXXX ( the remaining tenant ), with whom I have very limited contact, that there was a XXXX balance due for rent when he vacated. He said he received pandemic public rent assistance from XXXX County paying the rent in arrears in full. He sent me a screenshot but I don't know anything more than what he said. 

XXXX XXXX collected on this bond erroneously and it has significantly and falsely affected my credit. I have been working on trying to resolve this for weeks now. I contacted the collection company who were rude and condescending and would not supply any documentation. I then contacted the surety bond company and they said it was not them, but the bond was paid out by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and they said they needed to confirm my information with the leading company. I asked them for documentation about the claim on me and they have not provided it and have ignored my emails going forward. I have not heard back from anyone. I contacted XXXX XXXX, the property management company and they have acknowledged my emails and responded that it would be sent to the appropriate department... ..have not heard back from them. 

I have disputed the collection with XXXX and XXXX and the results were that the claim against me was valid. I was not allowed to say more than a sentence in the dispute.",,"National Credit Systems,Inc.",FL,337XX,,Consent provided,Web,2021-10-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4834086

Here are now the details associated with this case. 
I found the online bank XXXX listed by XXXX as FDIC insured and with a very attractive savings rate and thus decided to apply for an account. Proceeded with the online application process and submitted all my requested personal data and then after more than a week the account was opened and got online access to it. Subsequently I funded my new XXXX savings account from other personal bank accounts using initial withdraw initiated by XXXX as also XXXX transfers initiated by me on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
End of XXXX I scheduled another XXXX transfer from my XXXX account at an amount well below my current balance. Start of XXXX I received an email from XXXX stating that my external transfer capability got suspended. Figuring out that actually my entire online access to the account was suspended I called the banks customer service. They told me that my account was undergoing verification but this can be accelerated if I provide a copy of my driver license and most recent statements for my external accounts used in the funding process. I provided immediately all requested documents, confirmed by the banks representative who also told me they will soon follow-up with a resolution. 
I continued to check for status updates almost on a daily base. My emails remain unanswered. When I call the customer service line they tell me to wait for completion of the verification, refusing to give me an expected time for resolution. When I ask to talk to a supervisor or XXXX XXXX turned down or simply hung up. Even for my request to get the latest bank statement or to have the account closed and funds returned I was turned down. 
Also want to mention that all online actions to XXXX are redirected to a XXXX XXXX  XXXX. The site also states that all deposit products are provided by XXXX Bank and accounts opened via XXXX are marketed by XXXX. I tried to call directly XXXX Bank customer service but they claim not to have access to XXXX accounts.

553613,2022-10-04,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Flagstar Bank Escrow Issue Summary Flagstar Bank purchased my loan, and all associated obligations, from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified of this via a welcome packet sent from Flagstar on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon receipt of the welcome letter, I called Flagstar on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that there were no actions I needed to take to ensure a smooth transition to the new lender. Both the welcome packet, and the customer service representative, indicated that there were no actions I needed to take to ensure a smooth transition, except to create an online account with Flagstar, which I did. 

My first payment to Flagstar was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I received notice from my Homeowner 's Insurance company that the next year 's premium was coming due on XX/XX/XXXX. The notification indicated that This Is Not A Bill, and that a copy was sent to my mortgage loan servicer. Given Flagstar 's repeated indication that there were no actions I needed to take, I then naturally, took no action. I was away for much of XXXX. Upon returning home on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw a final notice from my Homeowner 's Insurance company indicating that my bill had not been paid. It further indicated that failure to pay would result in termination of my insurance, and thus, a lapse in coverage. 

I contacted Flagstar Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed that though Flagstar had the name and contact info for my insurance company, Flagstar was unable to make payment on behalf until I gave them permission to do so. This was contrary to what I was instructed previously. I gave Flagstar the needed permissions and they mailed a check, which would arrive XXXX days after the due date. They indicated an inability to wire or courier the funds to meet the obligations they purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX To prevent a lapse in coverage, my insurance company thus required a deposit on a credit card, from me that day, to cover the account until they received the check from Flagstar. I had no choice, so I paid on my credit card, and then received a reimbursement.

The following week, I requested an Escrow Waiver from Flagstar. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was granted an escrow waiver, but was informed of a large fee of over {$600.00} to move forward with the request. I have continually informed Flagstar that I am unable to accommodate payment of a fee to ensure that my bills are paid properly and on time. This is natural given the danger Flagstar nearly put me in, had I not been proactive. Flagstar, while admitting on XX/XX/XXXX that they are not legally required to levy the fee, insist upon it. Representatives have insisted that there is no way to remove it. 

Flagstar Bank is a company I never chose to be in business with. I refuse to be penalized for ensuring the security of my home and family.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Flagstar Bank, N.A.",NJ,08109,,Consent provided,Web,2022-10-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6049992

Upon depositing it, I was told by the teller all funds should be available the next day. After the teller deposited the check, I was told that the majority of the the check would be available the following day and the remainder would be available by that Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I have a written receipt stating this breakdown. 

The following day after the deposit, however, XX/XX/XXXX, I login to my account to see that all funds wont be available until XX/XX/XXXX with the message that it is assumed that the government issued check would not be honored. Id like to mention that I have never had a returned check on this particular account and I maintain over {$6000.00} in direct deposits each month. 

Moreover, I had a payment pending for {$2500.00}, that had a online notice saying that it was a partial hold on the deposited funds to honor the payment that was pending. I login today, XX/XX/XXXX, and see that the payment was returned while my check is being held for two weeks to clear. 

Today I will be further researching and inquiring as to what next steps I should take, as this is the third time that Bank of America has placed excessive discriminatory holds on my accounts because any check I deposit, along with money orders, are determined by BOA to allegedly have a high likelihood of being returned. I am a XXXX, XXXX woman, who again never had any checks returned on this account and in total I have banked with Bank of America for over 20 years. I feel discriminated against, considering I live in a predominantly XXXX zip code with a majority of the per capita income below the national poverty line. In contrast, I deposited the check in a predominately White zip code branch location where the per capita income levels are some of the highest in the country.

You can tell by comparison of the bank statements ( see attachments ). The XXXX statement 's date was illegally tampered with by computer software or other means when compared to the XXXX statement. Even the banker 's signature is in the exact same spot as the other statement. When I questioned Mrs. XXXX ( broker ) about this, she didn't admit it. There was no one else who could possibly do this other than her or her team. My closing date was delayed due to this issue. I also had to extend my lease because of this. 

I was shocked, frustrated, and shaken by what I had experienced. How difficult was it to just ask for permission to get a new bank statement from the bank? How could a professional team do such unprofessional work? At this point, it is dishonesty and fraud. She displayed ignorance, cynicism, and uncivil attitudes throughout the whole process.

So, I did and XXXX indicated he was the tec that could help clean up the XXXX. After a bit of instructions, he noted that a XXXX had gotten to my XXXX account and he would have a fraud representative call me from XXXX. That person called from XXXX XXXX which is a number for XXXX. He identified himself as XXXX XXXX and asked if we had authorized a {$23000.00} payment to a casino at XXXX the previous night ( XX/XX/XXXX ). My response was NO. so he said he would send an FDIC letter with instructions and we would need to set up a secure account with the exact same amount to allow the XXXX to ask if the false payment was authorized - just say no, and then if the secure account was authorized and just say yes, which would allow that money to then be reversed to return to my XXXX  account. By that time with all of the interruption by the said XXXX tec asking questions and giving instructions I was quite upset. 
Just did not click that the FDIC doesn't regulate Credit Unions. Then the instructions came for the secure account and moneys to be delivered to CITI bank in XXXX, VA routing XXXX Account name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account # XXXX an attempt to make that as an external transfer through my digital banking did not work so I was instructed to go to the bank in person to get the wire completed which I did- I was also told not to mention anything to the clerks regarding the hacking or the previous fraudulent wire to the casino because someone from the local bank was involved and had authorized that wire. OMG how can those scammers get me so rattled that I could miss those clues. The third person that was involved in the scam group was a man supposed to be from the FDIC named XXXX XXXX and I was transferred to him at some point in the drama. I imagine they will immediately move the funds from that CITI bank to another bank to disburse to themselves. We have asked XXXX to stop the wire and they will contact CITI bank but the wiring form has my signature so that makes it more difficult. I'm not sure who you are but I was looking for someone who could help retrieve our money. The wire was requested to be returned but Citi Bank has not returned the funds. A Call to Citi Bank Fraud department was answered by XXXX who said if I didn't have an account with them he could not help and to call my bank.

Now here is the problem if Equifax updated and verified these accounts but nothing within these accounts have changed, according to the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ), what was updated? Please examine the XXXX XXXX credit reports from XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, in the attachment named complete XXXX XXXX Reports for months of XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX, the attachment called account XXXX and the attachment called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to examine, check and to verify that these fields has not changed nor has any other data has changed at all within the last 3 months, which is a violation of the FCRA section ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ),. I took the liberty to create a 4th account box that has all the information including the 2 year payment histories of each account and it is found after the XXXX XXXX credit report of this account dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am attaching the letters I sent to Equifax with the signed and dated return receipts as an attachment called XXXX, for proof of my disputes and the last 6 months of the XXXX XXXX credit reports showing each of these accounts and highlighted text showing these 2 fields that were not changed down below in the attachment called visual proof. I am requesting that you, the CFPB, investigate these accounts and Euifax for blatant and maliciously attacking my credit, my life, my childrens lives and me by refusing to complete an investigation according to the FCRA section 623 8 ( A ) and the FCRA section 611 ( A ), failure to to do an independent investigation when asked by me according to the FCRA section 623 8 ( A ) and the FCRA section 611 ( A ), failure to change/delete an account after being shown numerous times the false and inaccurate data on my reports according to the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ), failure to provide documentation when I asked specifically for it according to the FCRA 611 ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ) and section 611 ( 6 ) ( A ), and failure to notify other investors of my current disputes by not placing the required notice of dispute in the comment section after the 30 day period after they first received my dispute as according to the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 3 ) and the FDCPA section 806 ( B ), all of these are hurting me financially, emotionally and physically by raising my stress levels and causing my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

The following is a list of accounts that I am requesting you, the CFPB, to investigate with you and also performing an investigation against the credit bureau known as Equifax for multiple violations as listed above. Again to see all the letters with the signed and dated return receipts please view the attachment called letters and to see visual proof from XXXX XXXX showing that there were never any changes made to these accounts, that there was never any independent investigations done within the last 6 months and to view and examine the missing required notice of dispute found on the XX/XX/XXXX investigation report see attachment called visual proof. Also you can see and verify that there was never any changes made to these accounts in the last 6 months except for the addition of the consumer dispute comment therefore how was my accounts updated as Equifax has stated in their investigations reports ( see attachment called investigation reports. Furthermore, I attached 3 credit reports dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, see attachment called credit reports, where you can also see that none of the data has been updated, a violation according to FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ), there is only one account missing the notice of dispute and that is found in the XXXX XXXX XXXX investigation report which is a violation according to FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 3 ) and the FDCPA section 806 ( B ), there was never any independent re-investigations done as I asked for in many letters proven by that none of the other data within this account has ever been updated or changed, another violation according to the FCRA section 623 8 ( A ) and FCRA section 611 ( A ) and failing to update or delete data that is inaccurate and being shown that this data is inaccurate, a violation of the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ). Now for the account called XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX let me show you all the inaccuracies and violations that I have found, by examining my XXXX XXXX  credit report dated XX/XX/XXXX, which you can see in the attachment called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and in the attachment called complete XXXX XXXX Reports for months XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, pdf. 

1. Delete for inaccuracy because XXXX reports this as a credit card and Equifax reports it as -. Delete for missing information. 

2. Delete for inaccuracy because there is no high credit value listed. Delete for missing information.

3. Delete for inaccuracy because XXXX reports the credit limit as {$0.00} and Equifax reports the credit limit as {$300.00}. How can 1 creditor report the identical information to 2 bureaus and both bureaus report differently? 

4. Delete for inaccuracy because XXXX reports the last reported date of XX/XX/XXXX and Equifax reports the last reported date as XX/XX/XXXX. How can 1 creditor report the same information but then 2 bureaus report different things? 

5. Delete for inaccuracy because Equifax is reporting XXXX XXXX is the credit limit and this is also known as a limit trap which is deliberate in nature to harm credit scores. 

6. Delete for inaccuracy and violation because the XXXX reports the date last active as XX/XX/XXXX and Euifax reports the date last active as XX/XX/XXXX. This means this account will naturally fall of my credit report on 2 different dates. This cant be true and accurate. 

7. Delete for inaccuracy and violation because the date of last payment is different on XXXX and Equifaxs reports. XXXX reports the date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX and Equifax reports the date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. This means that 7.5 years for statutory limitation will end on 2 different dates. This cant be true and accurate. 
8. Delete for inaccuracy and violation because the payment history shows XXXX charged off this account in XX/XX/XXXX while Equifax shows I paid on time in XX/XX/XXXX. How can this be accurate or even true? Furthermore Equifax is showing payments for the months of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX which is very inaccurate and wrong. Show me by mailing me the bank statements from XXXX   XXXXXXXX XXXX that I made these payments on time and for these months and I will believe that this account is true and accurate. Furthermore delete this account for showing payment history activity after the charge off date, which none of Equifaxs reports show, so what is the date this account was charged off? According to XXXX this date is XX/XX/XXXX. 

9. Delete for inaccuracy because XXXX is changing the charge off date and I need to use this date because Equifax doesnt report this date but XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX reports the charge off date as [ XX/XX/XXXX ] and in XX/XX/XXXX reports it as [ XX/XX/XXXX ] furthermore, Equifax reports no payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but in XX/XX/XXXX Equifax reports no payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX therefore making this payment history completely inaccurate. Also in XX/XX/XXXX Equifax states that no payments were made in the months of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. How can these payments be different each and every month? 

10. Delete for inaccuracy because the account name has changed a few times from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX  in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Is Equifax making blatant attacks on me in trying to confuse me or are they trying to prolong this account by changing the name so I wont continue to try and dispute this account? 

Now what I believe is happening here is that Equifaxs E-Oscar system is somehow reporting my other disputes from XXXX XXXX and XXXX as you can see by the attachment called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and according to the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ) this is a violation. If this is true then all these so called investigations is falsely reporting information therefore making all my results false and inaccurate again going by the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ) so these accounts that I am disputing must be deleted immediately and I also believe that this account specifically has been confused with another account of mine see attachment called account XXXX in the first section called myfico report dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

This clearly shows that accounts are being mixed together as shown by the field named company name where Equifax states XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX states it as XXXX XXXX XXXX delete this account immediately! Delete this whole account for multiple inaccuracies and multiple violations immediately!! 

Next lets take a look at all the inaccuracies and violations I have found in my account named XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. ACCOUNT NUMBER : XXXX from examining the credit files directly from Equifaxs website. 
1. Delete for inaccuracy and violation because you are reporting this account closed by you are missing the required date of last activity.

2. Delete for inaccuracy because Equifax is not reporting the terms for this account therefore it is missing needed information.

3. Delete for inaccuracy because Equifax refuses to report the high credit value after I asked them to do many times.

4. Delete for inaccuracy because the date of first delinquency equals the date of last payment which equals the delinquency first reported date all of which are XX/XX/XXXX. How can this true and accurate when this is saying on XX/XX/XXXX Equifax received my last payment but then reported me being late or delinquent on that same month? 

5. Delete for inaccuracy and violation because the address of this creditor is wrong, inaccurate and non-deliverable, see attachment called account XXXX page number : 6 for irrefutable proof. 

6. Delete for inaccuracy because the payment history is showing nothing therefore Equifax failed to provide required information.

7. Delete for inaccuracy because this account is missing information such as the date closed.

8. Delete for inaccuracy because the charge off amount is missing.

9. Now what I believe is happening here is that Equifaxs E-Oscar system is somehow reporting my other disputes from XXXX XXXX and XXXX as you can see by the attachment called proof that E- Oscar is not working.pdf and according to the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ) this is a violation. If this is true then all these so called investigations is falsely reporting information therefore making all my results false and inaccurate again going by the FCRA section 623 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( a ) so these accounts that I am disputing must be deleted immediately and I also believe that this account specifically has been confused with another account of mine see attachent called account XXXX in the first section called myfico report dated XX/XX/XXXX. This clearly shows that accounts are being mixed together as shown by the field named company name where Equifax states XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX states it as XXXX XXXX XXXX  delete this account immediately! Delete this whole account for multiple inaccuracies and multiple violations immediately!! 

Furthermore, in regards to Equifax not completing any investigations or re-investigations when I asked for them, I like to bring up XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX where it was said by the courts that it is the grave responsibility and duty of the CRAs to complete a reasonable and complete independent investigation into consumers accounts when feasible. I believe after 6 months this request has became feasible and required since Equifax decided that they did not have to do any investigations into my accounts. The courts also said that E-Oscar isnt an acceptable means of doing a complete and thorough investigation. 

Without further ado here is the list of accounts that I want deleted and for you, the CFPB, to investigate and then investigate Equifax for multiple violations and failure to do their job. 

Here are the list of accounts that need to be deleted immediately.

1913671,2022-09-22,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"On XX/XX/XXXX my Husband and I decided to look at new construction homes in XXXX Washington. We had just gotten married a few weeks prior to viewing the home and were just looking at what was available to us. Upon getting to XXXX XXXX we found a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX home that we felt would fit our future needs. It was on sale for {$510000.00} for their purple tag sale that month. We were told to just try applying and see what happens but to use their suggested mortgage lender Inspire Home Loans. As newlyweds and first-time home buyers, we were excited to possibly buy this new home. My husband is active military so we opted to use our VA loan. After filling out this application we informed our newly assigned loan officer XXXX XXXX that we have not yet received the XXXX that is given to us once we inform the XXXX of our legal marriage. XXXX told us this is not a problem we should still apply and try to move forward. He also was confused about which of us was active military and we clearly stated it was my husband multiple times. Throughout this process, XXXX has failed to remain clear on anything and we had to correct him multiple times on different things. A new issue arose when I told him I had just started my first job out of college and did not have 12 months of work history. XXXX still pressed us to move forward claiming everything will be fine and he can use my school time as work history. So this is what we did and a few weeks later we were told how much our loan would be, and how much we needed at closing. We then opted to tie our closing costs into our loan which does change the amount on the loan. XXXX still informed us we could qualify and everything would be okay. We asked when we should hand over our {$7500.00} earnest money to XXXX XXXX and XXXX said we were good to go and we can give our earnest money whenever. On the other end, XXXXXXXX XXXX told us that we had to give our earnest money by XX/XX/XXXX and that they had raised the price of our home within 24 hours of last speaking with their company about the price of our home. Even with this new knowledge, we moved forward and suddenly he needed proof of XXXX. We told him at the very beginning we have no control over when it will start, we went to the proper appointments through the XXXX and filed our marriage through them so we should be receiving it within a few months. As of today 's date XX/XX/XXXX, we still are waiting for the XXXX to start. A month or so went by after we signed and agreed to the new loan amount with closing costs included and issues arose in my place of work and I had to leave. At this point, I thought the loan would be over, and we'd be issued a denial and that would be that. But this was not the case, XXXX emailed me and said if I could find a new job before the end of XXXX we would be in the clear and still be able to close on the house. So it being the first week of XXXX and still wanting this home, I applied to anything and anywhere that would pay me. Of course, trying to rush something like this never works and I didn't hear back from anyone until I applied at XXXX. I did their initial screening and got approved and an offer letter. But the offer letter they send to people has a contingency in it that says I have to pass a background check and a drug screen. I did this, but their offer letter is mass sent out so it's automatically in it. XXXX says this works, but he needs an XXXX  number which I didn't have. At this point, my husband and I were so confused and tired of stressing over all of this that we made the choice to back away from the loan. We made a phone call to XXXX and called XXXXXXXX XXXX  and everyone knew. Or so we thought. A few days later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email claiming they were forced to move forward with the loan because my husband and I failed to let them know what we wanted. So they denied us based on my work history and current employment status. This obviously is not true as we had backed away on XX/XX/XXXX. We were then told we could not receive our earnest money back which we had expected however now we are upset because they are not issuing the correct information and denying us something that we feel they would have done regardless of my job situation. We feel they led us astray and to believe that we could qualify for a large home loan that we never could truly afford. At this point, we would like to see if we can get our earnest money back and walk away. Do you have any information about if it's possible to get our earnest money back?

13215,2023-07-12,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Getting a loan or lease,Credit denial,"In XX/XX/2023, I applied to lease a Mercedes XXXX from the XXXX. XXXX Mercedes-Benz dealership . The total value of the lease agreement was approximately {$120000.00}.

Despite my robust financial standing, including a XXXX  score of over 800, an annual income of {$340000.00}, and more than {$150000.00} in cash savings, my application was denied. Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC informed me that the reason for this denial was that I had not previously leased or purchased a car worth {$120000.00}. 

Subsequently, I was approved to lease a vehicle up to a value of {$92000.00}, despite my creditworthiness and demonstrated financial capacity to manage the initially requested lease amount. 

This explanation for denial raises serious concerns, given my understanding that it is not legally sound to gatekeep the approval of lease agreements based on a consumer 's prior purchase or lease history. It is particularly worrisome when an applicant, like myself, possesses a robust financial profile indicating their ability to meet lease obligations. 

I have reached out to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC , seeking clarification and assistance regarding this matter. However, I have not been provided with clear reasons or satisfactory assistance thus far. Despite this, I remain hopeful that they will respond and address my concerns. 

Given the absence of clear financial impediments and the lack of satisfactory communication from Mercedes-Benz , I am left with an unsettling suspicion that factors unrelated to my creditworthiness and financial standing may have influenced the decision on my lease application. 

Based on these circumstances, I am led to suspect potential discriminatory practices, possibly based on my race or ethnicity. This suspicion has resulted in significant distress and a sense of being unfairly treated. 

The impact of this decision extends beyond mere financial aspects, causing considerable disappointment and anguish. I am seeking a comprehensive investigation into this matter, to ensure compliance with fair lending practices and regulations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), which explicitly prohibits discrimination on several bases, including race and ethnicity.",,Mercedes Benz Financial Services,CA,92883,,Consent provided,Web,2023-07-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7234238

1406835,2023-06-21,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for 11 years and recently I started to have some issues with them. Today being the 3rd incident with them and I have had it with them and do not know what to do. 
I would take my paper checks every 2 weeks into a bank branch and they informed me one day about the mobile banking and how easy it was to use. So instead of going into the bank I figured I'd give it a try. 
I received an alert that my account was "" on hold '' after I deposited a {$1500.00} check from our family business into my personal account with Well Fargo though their mobile deposit and I apologize for not remembering the exact day but it was about 2 months ago and I kinda freaked out because I never had this happen before. They held that deposit and I sorted it out, they made a claim that their was insufficient funds from the check I was trying to deposit and that they were going to place a hold on my account for 7 days. I had to make numerous calls and go into branch locations to get it sorted out in a timely manner. 
Skip ahead anther 2 weeks and I ended up hurting my right hand which is my dominant hand. I had to go to an emergency XXXX clinic and they thought it was XXXX  so the wrapped my hand up in a half splint also known as an ulnar gutter splint in which case only my first finger and my thumb were accessible to write on my dominate hand, the remaining 3 fingers were completely covered in this splint and not accessible. I tell you that because of this next part. I went to use the Wells Fargo mobile deposit app to deposit the same amount {$1500.00} from the same account ( nothing new ) and my hand writing to sign the check was a little messed up, but honestly it looked like my signature just a little more scribbly. Instead of calling me to verify to see if it was me they decided to place another hold on my account and the {$1500.00} was not accessible. I kid you not I spoke to 5 different people over the phone and I visited 3 different branch locations in a span of 3 days to get this cleared up and the 3rd day I spoke to someone who told me to go into a branch location to "" VERIFY '' my hand was XXXX ... ... I can't make this up. I deposited the funds into my own account, using my cell phones and my account and I have to show you my hand is XXXX. Anyway, I go into the 3rd location and verify my hand is XXXX, they pulled me into I'm guessing the branch managers office ( he didn't introduce himself he just acted like it was an inconvenience for him ) and they finally released the funds into my account, just to literally take out {$1400.00} from my account like 7 days later and say the written part of the check says "" Fifteen '' but the box part of the check says {$1500.00} so they took BACK {$1400.00} and gave my {$15.00} from that check I fought so hard to prove it was me depositing that check with a messed up right hand. I literally can not make this up and as I am writing this it's just making me all the more frustrated before I tell you what happed today which was unreal. 
So toady I receive 2 emails from Wellsfargo. One at XXXX and the other at XXXX that my account has a negative balance of - {$360.00}. I am completely baffled by this. Their reason this time is "" Insufficient funds at inquiry time ''. I deposited that check again which is from the same amount {$1500.00} and the same account as mentioned above. I deposited it on Friday the XXXX at XXXX. Today is Wednesday the XXXX and is 5 days after I deposited the check which by the way shows a cleared balance that I have been using because I deposited it on Friday before XXXX. They placed another hold on my account and as we speak my account is going to remain negative - {$360.00} until XX/XX/XXXX which is 7 days negative. I am so frustrated and I don't know what to do. I called the XXXX number to see what was going on because I was in shock as to why this keeps happening and she told me there was nothing she could do for me and that I have to wait until the XXXX for my funds to show up in my account. I am so confused I really don't know what to do. Please help I have never been treated like this before by a bank and to be told one minute I have money in my account and then have it deducted out of the blue over and over again without notice is terrifying. I am at the point that when I do a deposit I am actually scared of what is going to happen because of what has been happening.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,27410,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2023-06-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7150605

1315744,2021-10-26,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Hello, I am here with a second complaint for the company Square. I made the first complaint on XX/XX/2021 to CFPB which I have quoted below. The CashApp Square bank keeps awarding the merchant the claim when I have shown proof that she did not render services and lied and manipulated paperwork. I feel as though because she is one of their customers on the business side and they dont want to lose her business they are siding with her. This makes no sense. I have sent screenshots of clearly where she has said different things from her website and email/text messages and has changed the address without my knowledge. They keep allowing her to review the case and that is not fair because Im not the one scamming here, the merchant is. Why would I want someone who stole money from me, lied on me, lied to me, and manipulated paperwork to cover her own mistakes? Im thinking either they have shady business along with her or they are not carefully reading my evidence that I am sending in. Something needs to be done about this matter! I even have screenshots included where she manipulated her website to make it fit and look like she is in the right. I have the screenshot from when I booked where it says she would come to my location and also where after she lied and took my money she attempted to change it but left the part on there where she says she comes to you. I really need this investigated. But as stated earlier I have attached my original complaint I sent to you all. 

Complaint number XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX before booking to ensure I had correct information. I stated to her I seen a special online on XXXX for a XXXX XXXX for me and a few of my friends. She advised me to go ahead and book which I did that same day. She contacted me letting me know that with XXXX I would not receive all the services so I canceled with XXXX to book directly through her site. I waited a few days until XXXX refunded my order to place the order through her direct website. Once I received my refund from XXXX, I proceeded to her website and booked the event for {$420.00}. I read the description and it stated verbatim You can choose services and if you need our location with party coordinator which she has went in on the website and tried to change but I have the screenshot of before and after she changed it without my knowledge. While I was on her website attempting to book the service I seen where she asked for customers location, so before proceeding I called again to ask if she would be traveling to us because what other reason would you need my address? She replied yes and I said great I will go ahead and book I just wanted to clarify. We hung the phone up and I proceeded to book. I received an email with all information including what, when, duration, price, and where. In which all of this information is the information I provided her with when booking on her website. I have the screen shots of that as well. She also changed that information without my knowledge because in the screenshot she sent me it states that you can edit booking and it is not the same address I gave when giving her my booking info. The address I gave her to come to which is also included in the booking email is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but she changed it to another address without my knowledge which I now figured out is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX. It is not good business to change info on a service booked without the customers knowledge then blame the customer for your mistake and lie about it. I contacted Cashapp with info about disputing the charge and sent them everything over proving I was being taken advantage of because she clearly changed her information after the fact she found out she was wrong. They offered me a provisional credit but eventually awarded to the business which I feel is not fair because there was information changed on her website and booking site without my knowledge after I received the information she gave me from the beginning. To me first impression is everything. I would have never decorated or cooked food for the event had I been aware it was going to be held at another location. This is two businesses taking advantage of a customer with valid evidence You can not tell a consumer one thing then go behind their backs and change it. If you would look at the email screenshots you will see the dates as to where she changed it from one location to another. Also, another screenshot is where she sent me a screenshot of her address where it clearly says edit booking and that is what she did prior to sending to me. Because my original email from the day I book XX/XX/XXXX has the booking address I gave her. There is a two part screenshot for the booking email I received before it was changed without my knowledge, I couldnt fit it all in one so there are two images.",,Square Inc,GA,30016,,Consent provided,Web,2021-10-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4846320

I immediately called my bank and asked them to block any debits from VENMO, at the time there were no debits noted on my bank account.

I again sent email and phone requests that I wanted my VENMO account CLOSED. I was told it could not be closed as it was frozen. I received an email that the account was frozen. I called Venmo again a month later and AGAIN requested that my account be CLOSED.

On XX/XX/XXXX, VENMO without my authorization allowed a friend to mistakenly pay me {$100.00} via VENMO, this was my first knowledge that my account was NOT FROZEN or CLOSED as I had numerous times requested.

I was attempting to make a XXXX USD payment, to my Bank of America Secure Credit Card. I opened up the Mobile Banking Application on my cellular device to the Bank of America website. When I first attempted to make a XXXX USD payment, the software thought I said to pay the entire statement of charges, which was XXXX USD, and the software was processing the payment. When I realized what the software was doing, I said to self. I only needed to make the XXXX USD payment. So I then went back into the mobile banking application to make the XXXX USD payment. So at this juncture, two payments for XXXX USD XXXX USD payment had already been made. The very next morning, I attempted to contact customer service at Bank of America, to rectify the situation and to make sure that both previous payments has been declined and a XXXX USD payment was made via telephone. After 1 hour and 38 minutes, I finally reached the customer service. I explained the situation about the mobile banking software debiting XXXX USD and I needed her to cancel the previous transactions and take my telephone payment of XXXX USD, to cover XXXX 's payment. Prior to contacting customer service at Bank of America-the 1 hour and 38 minute wait call, I contacted my XXXXXXXX XXXX, to let them know about the mobile banking software for Bank of America and how it could potentially overdraw my checking account. The XXXX XXXX Member Services Associate immediately opened up a claim at the bank, that claim number is XXXX. Back to Bank of America-after a few days, I attempted to contact Bank of America once again, to find out why they debited my checking account for the XXXX and I knew about the XXXX USD payment that I was truly initiating. After the young women went and debited my account after I asked her not to. Telling her that it was going to overdraw my checking account, I said enough is enough and I closed out the secure credit card. The secure credit limit was XXXX USD. Now three months later, Bank of America, is pinging my credit reports with negative commentary, stating that the credit cards payments were declined and that I am now 3 months in arrears. All due to the faulty Mobile Banking Software. I have been in a constant contact with XXXX XXXX and have asked them every way that I can-'Did bank of America, receive all three payments XXXX USD '? This is the amount that closed out the account and paid it in full. Chime bank reports to me today via Honorable Ms. XXXX, stating-'Yes, all three payments were made to the account. It is closed and paid in full. Not just that, Bank of America actually charged you XXXX twice ' ... I have XXXX XXXX XXXX Plus and all of this hoopla is making my XXXX+ worse. Waking me in the middle of the night. I have moved into my sister and brother-in-laws home due to the XXXX+, after they had noticed changes in my being. They have stated that 'you shouldn't worry about this issue. You need to have the credit bureaus clear your report of the derogatory comments and you should sue Bank of America for Defamation of Character, Mental Anguish, Slander, and a whole bunch of other hoopla. They are very good people. If you have an email address I would be happy to submit my XXXX Banking Statements for XXXX 2020, which actually shows when, where, how the payments were made.

As I sent a letter off to Bank of America tonight XXXX, it reads in the final statement-Your organization has either misapplied the payments, one of your people has the COVID-19 virus and is sick or you have someone that pilfered the payments. Since I live on Social Security and a small VA Pension and since I know almost nothing about suing a company, that probably won't transpire, but they can not get away with espionage, high treason, subversive activities, sedition, corruption and or greed.

m It May Concern, This letter is a formal complaint that you are reporting inaccurate and incomplete credit information. I am distressed that you have included the information below in my credit profile and that you have failed to maintain reasonable proc
edures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish. Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information. Every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct. The following information therefore needs to be re-investigated. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law toverify, through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract, any and all accounts that you post on a credit report. Otherwise anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account. 

I demand to see verifiable proof ( i.e. : an original consumer contract with my signature on it ) that you have on file for the account listed below. Your failure to positively verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain credit. Under the FCRA, unverifiable accounts must be removed and if you are unable to provide me a copy of verifiable proof, you must remove the account listed below. I demand that the following account be verified or removed immediately : 1. The inquiry was not authorized CREDITOR Please remove it from my credit report. 

I respectfully request to be provided proof of thisalleged item, specifically the contract, note or other instrument bearing my signature. 

Failing that, the item must be deleted from the report as soon as possible. This information is entirely inaccurate and incomplete, and as such represents a very serious error in your reporting. Please delete this misleading information and supply a corrected credit profile to all creditors who have received a copy within the last six months, or the last two years for employment purposes.

Additionally, please provide the name, address, and telephone number of each credit grantor or other subscriber.

Under federal law, you have thirty ( 30 ) days to complete your investigation.

Regions bank couldnt help the I in terms of the online access as few years back ( XXXX ) I had past relationship with Regions bank and that resulted into NOT able to setup online access for the I. I put a lot of efforts but no success in terms of getting online access. One has to have online access then only they can enroll for the online statements. I made multiple calls to Regions bank customer service and emailed the local branch but no success. During COVID-19 wait time on telephone lines is too long but still I tried his best. Due to no online access I couldnt setup the online statement within the first 30 days of account opening. I called and emailed Regions bank customer service and local branch but no success.. This was definitely not the fault of I NOT to enable online account statement in the first 30 days of account opening.

Finally, I filed CFPB ( Consume Financial Protection Bureau ) Complaint # XXXX filed on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX for no online account access. Regions bank gave round about answers for this. XXXX XXXX from Regions local branch also called but no success. I worked with local Branch manager, XXXX XXXX, to setup online access but no success regarding that. I tried his best to get online access within the first 30 days of account opening. Finally, I has to work extended hours to get the online access. But by the time, I got online access and setup online statements it was beyond 30 days of account opening. But not able to register for online statements was not at all my fault. Moreover, Regions didnt send even a single bank statement to my home address which means that by default online statement was already set, may be due to past relationship I had with Regions. Which means that Regions Bank either violated laws by either not sending the monthly statement by postal mail to the Customer, i.e. me, OR Regions Bank is just coming up with the excuses NOT to pay the promotion to the I. If Regions Bank still argues that they didnt sent a paper statement to the I then Regions Bank is violating these laws : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX  as I had done at least one transaction but I didnt receive any paper statement from Regions Bank initially. And if Regions Bank argues that Regions Bank didnt send the paper statement because I as per his past relationship enrolled into online banking and thus online statements then Regions Bank should honor the {$400.00} or {$200.00} promotional cash back bonus. Moreover, its Regions Bank which couldnt help the I in terms of setting up online access within first 30 days and it was purely the fault of Regions Bank.

To resolve this issue, I reached out to Customer Service of Regions bank via various communication channels including but not limited to emails, chat, phone calls. When issue was not resolved, I has to be escalate this matter to CFPB ( Consume Financial Protection Bureau ) via 3 different CFPB complaints.

Even after meeting all the terms and conditions in a timely manner, Regions Bank denied the cash back bonus of {$400.00} or {$200.00} to me. For that I filed some other CFPB complaints XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Regions bank came up with another excuse that I didnt enroll for online statements, thus denied cash back bonus. Please refer all the CFPB complaints, response of Regions bank and chat regarding this issue.

When I noticed the charges on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number immediately, reported the fraud, and my card was cancelled by XXXX XXXX at that time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was issued a provisional credit from XXXX XXXX of {$2900.00}. At that time, it was cancelled out all of the fraud charges from the XXXX & XXXX. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX also decided to give my account provisional credit of {$2900.00}, so I had DOUBLE plus {$1.00} the amount of credit that I should have received. I knew that this was incorrect but assumed that the double credits would be adjusted. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX realizing I had to many credits began reversing the provisional credits and removed {$2300.00} that was over credited to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, realizing that XXXX of the provisional credits was not reversed, XXXX charged my account for the {$490.00} dollars instead of reversing the additional charge. This cause my statement to exceed the amount I should have been charged. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX XXXX stating that when the {$490.00} was added back to my account, this made my credit card bill over {$700.00}, and it should have been a maximum of {$360.00}. And I felt that something happened with my account and it was overcharging me. I was advised that my statement was correct and just to pay it. I requested all the investigation notes from the fraud to be sent to me so I could review those myself since I did not think the statement was correct. I advised that based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act it was my right to receive this information and I wanted it. I was advised that it would be sent out to me within 7-10 business days. 

I called back after the 7-10 business days and gave the same information and advised that I wanted this information. A different representative stated that my request was not completed to receive all the investigation notes and resubmitted the request. I waited the 7-10 business days again. And did NOT receive the requested information. 

I called back again and requested a supervisor, whom I told the story to again and he advised that I was wrong me requesting the investigation and XXXX XXXX was not required to send me the information that I was requesting, though I pointed out the FCRA that was not correct, but he stated that he would help me with my error. When I told him, that something happened to the reversal and I was being overcharged I just wanted my statement to be correct so I could actually pay it. He began reviewing my statements and concluded that something was wrong but would have to look into it to find out. He was having the same issue I was, where the math was not adding up. He advised he would call me back. 

I received NO call back, so I called back again. I got another supervisor that I explained everything too and got the same responses, except regarding my request to receive all the investigation notes from when the fraud happened in XXXX. I was told at that time, that there was no investigation into the fraud, which is why I did not receive the information I requested due to the fact their only information was what I provided. Wow! That made me understand why I was never mailed the information again. This manager lady stated she would review my statements to try and understand why I had a such a large discrepancy with my statements. She told me she would call me back, I said fine, but had no faith she would. But she did call back, stating that she was still looking into it. 

A couple days later, I received a call back, but I missed the call, so I called the XXXX XXXX back. I got another manager gentleman that read the notes on my account, from what I assume the lady manager who called and left me a message, that stated I was not entitled to double credits and I know other adjustments were needed. I told the man that I did NOT want double credits. Something happened from the charge of {$490.00} on XX/XX/XXXX that caused my bill to increase by a lot and I only wanted to pay what I actually owed. 

My XX/XX/XXXX Statement was {$570.00}, and I believe it should have been {$360.00}. I am somehow being over charged- to me- by {$200.00} and no one can review, check, or show me where the additional amount is coming from. I waited for more corrections from XXXX to XXXX before I paid the difference that I do not believe is correct and in XX/XX/XXXX, my statement was {$220.00} and because I did not pay the full amount- that I am disputing in XXXX, I was charged interest. 

My balance is now {$0.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX because I do not want to be billed for interest on a disputed amount and I am still waiting on a callback from a manager regarding my disputes.",,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,IL,617XX,,Consent provided,Web,2021-03-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4237839

I also filed a complaint with XXXX and they did send me an image of that check ( ATTACHED ) which the county said that was the one deposited. The money source has failed to do this or their due dilligence.

Everytime i contact them they just send me a standard verbiage. This has been 3 months. One time i called the money source and the property tax department told me the check says its sent out but wasnt so they might use it for XX/XX/XXXX taxes. That is unacceptable. its not showing up in the escrow account. Everything about this is unacceptable and i expect the funds returned to me and my escrow account closed. I will pay XX/XX/XXXX taxes and all taxes and insurance going forward. I expect a refund check of {$3100.00}",,"MONEY SOURCE, THE",KS,67226,,Consent provided,Web,2023-02-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6543718

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectifica
tion of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... .....",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",TN,XXXXX,,Consent provided,Web,2022-04-13,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,5445868

XXXX XXXX, XXXX. responded back on XX/XX/2021 stating as quoted XXXX is no longer serving your account. We notified our client of your request for validation. Any documents in support of this debt were or will be mailed to you directly by our client. I then received a letter in the mail the same day XX/XX/2021 from Chase stating as quoted We will stop contacting you about this account by phone and mail. I then made another complaint with XXXX XXXX, XXXX. on XX/XX/2021 stating that Chase has provided the proper validation documentation. Chase then sent me another letter stating as quoted We sent the account documents you requested. I then received a envelop in the mail from Chase that was supposed to be documents validating the alleged debt and what they sent me VALIDATES NOTHING. 
Pursuant to FDCPA 15 USC 1692c ( a ) Communication with the consumer generally Without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, a debt collector may not communicate with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt. As a consumer, I never have Chase prior consent to communicate with me about this alleged debt. Pursuant to FDCPA 15 USC 1692c ( b ) Chase communicated with a 3rd party to sell the alleged debt and gave them my name and location information without my consent which is an invasion of privacy. Pursuant to 15 USC 1692g ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor. When I requested for validation of debt Chase could not proved the proper documents as stated by federal law according to 15 USC 1692g. Pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( p ) The term unauthorized use, as used in section 1643 of this title, means a use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and from which the cardholder receives no benefit. I did not give Chase Bank AUTHORITY to use my credit card which is my social security card and pursuant to 15 USC 1601 ( l ) The term credit card means any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit nor did I benefit from the unauthorized use. Theyve contacted me numerous times regarding the alleged debt, sold the debt to a third party and gave them my location information, and reported the account as a charge off on my credit record to the credit reporting agencies without my consent which is negatively impacting my credit report. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( B ) which should be excluded from a consumer credit report any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device.

The assistant vice president of customer relations her name is XXXX XXXX, I have asked XXXX XXXX for documentation supporting the overdraft that I currently have, I want to verify that I signed any disclosures regarding transferring my account which she has never furnished. I have a minimum of six calls going to HSBC Bank regarding my checking account and credit line, On one of the calls I spoke with a young lady and I said to her that I was not interested in going to XXXX Bank for the obvious reasons, the fees are ridiculously high and their customer service is very very poor they are not here in New York, where we can go and speak to someone so it's not in my best interest to have a bank I can not go to if I have concerns if I have problems, I like to be in front of someone. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating, very rudely to me that my credit line was going over to XXXX Bank I specifically asked her please verify that the recorded calls will identify one of the representatives stating because the account is not paid off it will stay at HSBC, she informed me during the call that it was only two calls that made to this customer service about my account, I told her no, a minimum of six since XXXX was made, I asked you to please send me a copy of the disclosures for the overdraft and I have yet to receive it. This transfer has been a problem for many people as well as myself when I tried calling to discuss anything with HSBC they flagged your account, by you entering your social security number it identifies you're one of the customers that's being transferred and no one picks up, it tells you to call a different number so that you don't have any type of communication with anybody or questioning anybody about the account or the transfer until it's actually completed these are the experince i have, so they are forcing people to do things without being held accountable for the unprofessional conduct in which they are displaying, I have asked her in emails please provide the disclosures you have of my signature signing this, I have also asked for bank statements with all pages for the last 6 months showing deposit credits withdrawals I have yet to receive, this is important for me to show Trans actual history between both accounts, the disclosures they will not provide me I am sure it's already went over to this transferring Bank which I did not and am not comfortable with. 
XXXX XXXX the vice president of customer relations has very unprofessional conduct with me, she feels what she says is going to happen regardless of my concern or if it will benefit regardless of the importance of the ability for someone to go to a branch to sit down and discuss issues, problems, Etc. I call customer service at XXXX bank and it's a very very poor professional response. I want my overdraft account to be stopped I do not want to deal with XXXX on this transfer. I would like for it to stay there and I will pay it off, they have recently sent me checks so I can make payments against my account for other creditors. XXXX XXXX is taking advantage of the consumers by forcing them to do things that are not in their interest for monetary gain. I am still waiting for all pages of my bank statement I am also still waiting for all pages of my overdraft account. 
I was informed, my overdraft is moving over to XXXX bank and the checking account is closed due to a negative balance, I paid my XXXX from another bank on the XXXX of XXXX and received a check back for the {$82.00} on the XXXX of XXXX, the checking account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX, i spoke to XXXX XXXX again she said the bank is not moving my checking account because it close but the overdraft is going to the citizen bank. 
How can HSBC close my account after sending me my money back and transfer my overdraft with a balance to a bank with high interest, this is unfair and I open up the overdraft at the branch where the customer service representative fill out the application and I signed it, I never received the terms and condition until today XX/XX/XXXX, by email. 
this transaction with HSBC to XXXX bank has and is unfair to many customers and unfair, many people did not receive anything until the last week before the transfer is complete my checking was a premier account and was changed to a regular account and charged monthly with out them informing me that it was and has occurred, all premier account are staying with HSBC, there is unfair treatment with this. XXXX XXXX informed me she had 8 recording of calls she listen to on those recording you will find what was said to me about my account from her representative and what I was able to do.

Despite my previous attempts to resolve this matter, the inaccurate, unverifiable, and invalidated information remains on my credit report. Therefore, I am issuing this final offer of settlement before pursuing litigation under FCRA provisions. 

As per the FCRA, it is your responsibility to maintain a copy of the original creditors ' documentation to verify the accuracy of the information reported. However, you have failed to provide any such documentation as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore, you have not provided the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, it is explicitly stated that all unverifiable information must be promptly deleted. 

Despite these legal obligations, you have not taken the necessary steps to rectify the inaccuracies in my credit report. This continued violation of the FCRA is in direct contravention of the civil liability provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1681n for willful noncompliance and 15 U.S. Code 1681o for negligent noncompliance. I want to emphasize that I am prepared to pursue litigation to seek relief and recover all monetary damages entitled to me under Section 616 and Section 617 if the mentioned inaccuracies are not immediately deleted. 

I demand the following items to be deleted from my credit report as they are either inaccurate, unverifiable, or invalidated : XXXX Account Number : XXXX This account is unfamiliar to me, and I have no recollection of belonging to it. I insist that you remove this account from my credit report without delay. 

XXXX  XXXX Account Number : XXXX Despite your claim of updating this account, no changes have been made, and the incorrect information remains. I demand the removal of these incorrect late payments from this account promptly. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX Account Number : XXXX Similar to the previous account, no updates have been made, and the incorrect information persists. I request the immediate removal of these incorrect late payments from my credit report. 

XXXX Account Number : XXXX I have found no evidence supporting my ownership of this account. I demand the removal of this inaccurate information from my credit report without any further delay. 

XXXX Account Number : XXXX I am perplexed as to how you continually verify events that never occurred. I have no memory of being late with any payments. I expect you to remove this harmful incorrect data from my credit file immediately. 

I want to reiterate that failure to comply with federal law within 30 days of receiving this certified letter may result in legal action seeking compensation of {$5000.00} per violation, including defamation, negligent enablement of identity fraud, FCRA violations, and financial injury. 

I also want to notify you that depending on your response, I may publicly disclose potential issues with your company through an online press release, including documentation of any potential small claims action. Copies of this letter and my complaint have been sent to the relevant organizations listed below for their reference : [ CC : Law Firm XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ] [ CC : XXXX XXXX Assistant Director of Enforcement Consumer Financial Protection Bureau1700 G.

My previous mortgage company sent the balance of my escrow account to XXXX to depossit into my account. The check was cashed in XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX but never applied to my account. My monthly mortgage payment were {$1200.00} and they increased them to {$1500.00} due to the low balance in my escrow account. I contacted the Loancare and informed them of the error of my mortgage payment and my escrow accoutn. Informing them that a check in the amount of {$2600.00} was sent to XXXX. XXXX uses Loancare as a subservice. Loancare is the one who has been sending me notices regarding my mortgage and escrow accounts. I contacted Loancare from XX/XX/XXXX to current, XX/XX/XXXX. I have supplied them with a copy of the cashed check and the fraud investigation from the bank stating that the check was cashed by the intend payee. Through all of this I continued to pay my monthly mortgage payment of {$1200.00}. I refused to pay the {$1500.00}, for one reason due to my personal budgeting I couldn't afford an additional {$300.00} to come out of my budget due to an error on the company filing system. I provided over and over all the information needed to the company to recify this situation in a timely manner. The information was sent via email to the Escalation Team, Loss Resolution, and to customer service supervisor XXXX XXXX. They continued not to resolve the issue and would not truly look into the matter. They continue to state that my account was delinquent because I did not pay the increase amount of {$1500.00} even though I paying the {$1200.00} monthly on time. They reported delinquent payments to the credit bureaus even when they informed me that nothing will be reported until this problem was resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from Loancare Escalation Team informed me that the problem could be that the check was sent to XXXX and that there was nothing they could do that I needed to contact XXXX to locate the check. I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and sent the information to them. They acknowledged that the check went to the correct place but they didn't know where the check was currently. I had to complete another compliant form for XXXX to look into this matter. XXXX emailed me stating that they will contact Loancare. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Loancare to see if XXXX had contacted them on this matter and representative XXXX mentioned that there was no notes on my file stating that XXXX had contacted them. XXXX transferred me to XXXX in the Escalation Department. I explained my situation to XXXX and informed her that I want them to stop reporting negative payments on my credit report and that XXXX will be contacting them about my escrow check. XXXX put me on hold to review my account. After sitting on hold for 45 minutes, she picked up and hung up the phone. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX and spoke with XXXX and she didn't have any updates on my claim. She transferred me to XXXX. XXXX mentioned that she forward the case to Loancare to investigate and Loancare bounced it back to XXXX to investigate. She mentioned that XXXX will look into it and get back to me later this week. She also mentioned that she was sorry that there has been a lot of checks just sitting at XXXX and not applied to anyone account. This missing check has made my escrow account to reflect not the required balance for the month of XXXX. This situation has affected my mental health and has caused extreme stress and XXXX.

The transaction was posted to my bank account on XX/XX/2022. Despite this, Chase refuses to apply the payment to my account until XX/XX/2022, almost a week after my payment was made and posted. 

I called Chase 's customer service number on XX/XX/2022 at XXXX PM EST and was informed by a customer service rep that I would be able to speak with the Payment department when it opened at 7 AM EST to get this issue resolved and have my payment applied promptly. When I called on the morning of XX/XX/2022, I encountered several rude customer service agents who gave me conflicting information. At one point, I was told that I have done nothing wrong but it is just an internal Chase policy to hold on to the funds for several days when an account is new. While I completely understand the need to verify the source of funds, Chase has been unreasonable in trying to resolve this issue. 

My Chase business account has been opened for the past three months and I have two bank accounts and a personal credit card with Chase, that have all been in good standing. I have never paid late and I have excellent credit. I have have spoken to my bank where the payment was posted and they offered to provide verification to Chase. However, Chase refuses to accept any form of verification from my bank that would expedite this process. 

I have been on hold for the past 40 minutes trying to speak to a supervisor and it appears no one will answer. 

As it stands, I have pending transactions that are about to be posted to my account and potentially declined because I do not have full access to my credit line. Chase has removed the money from my account for days at this point and refuses to give me access to it. 

Additionally, since this is a new account, there was an opening bonus offer. Chase has repeatedly done everything in its power to limit my use of this card, which I believe is directly related to preventing me from earning my new account bonus. In effect, if I can not charge anything to the card, then I can not meet the minimum spend in order to get this bonus.

CHRYSLERCAP Account XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me XXXX  days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately disputed this information with CHRYSLERCAP and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

XXXX  XXXX, Virginia XXXX, VA XXXX ) I have tried to have my PMI removed from my account, since my original loan value was under {$130000.00} and now my home is appraised at above {$180000.00} and is much lower than the 50 % Loan to Value that mortgage companies require, in order to drop this mortgage insurance. I applied to have a refinance with XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX and therefore paid under {$500.00} for an appraisal. That is how I know my PMI should be dropped because of the amount the appraisal came in at. I have attempted contact with XXXX XXXX to review that appraisal since XXXX which would put the appraisal still under the 4 month rule of it being active and current. However all I get is the run around, even when I have been transferred to PMI supervisors. They tell me that they will review my appraisal and if the LTV is lower than 50 % to the total amount owed, they will retroactively credit the PMI to my account. However, all I receive from them after a month and a half of waiting for a reply each time is a generic, auto generated letter from Loancare, which is their servicing company, stating what the process is for cancellation of PMI. There is absolutely no mention of the appraisal they have been emailed multiple times, which each PMI supervisor could see on my records and acknowledged the receival of. I want my PMI dropped and I want my account to be retroactively credit the {$99.00} they charge me monthly, since my initial request to them in XXXX of XXXX. 
Here is the log of my contact with them. 
Week of XX/XX/XXXX, initial PMI request on the phone. 
XX/XX/XXXX emailed and tried to follow up with my request and attached the appraisal in email. 
XX/XX/XXXX emailed to follow up again. 
XX/XX/XXXX emailed to follow up again. 
XX/XX/XXXX called to follow up, spoke to XXXX, she said the review process would take till XX/XX/XXXX and I would receive correspondence in 10 days. I did receive yet another one of those auto generated PMI letters. 
XX/XX/XXXX spoke to XXXX, asked to be transferred to a PMI supervisor, XXXX, then XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX emailed appraisal to XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX spoke to XXXX in the customer service center, asked to be transferred to a PMI supervisor, got hung up on after 40 minutes of being on hold. 
XXXX spoke to XXXX, then transferred to XXXX. She stated that she is able to see my appraisal, that someone from the PMI supervisor team would review it and would retroactively credit my account, once they confirm the new appraised worth of my home. 
Week of XX/XX/XXXX received yet another of the auto generated PMI letters, which I now have about five of.

I am requesting that you allow me to validate the alleged debt. I am unaware of any outstanding medical bills that I possess, and I am seeking the name and hospital/medical provider to which I owe the debt and a detailed breakdown of the fees that I owe. Additionally, I am allowed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) to protect my privacy and medical records from third parties. I did not give permission to any of my current or prior medical providers to release any of my medical information to a third party. I am aware that the HIPAA does allows the release of limited information about me but anything more is to only be revealed with the patients authorization. Therefore, my request is twofoldvalidation of debt and HIPAA authorization. 
Please provide breakdown of fees including any collection costs and medical charges. Provide a copy of my signature with the provider of service to release my medical information to you. 
Cease any credit bureau reporting until the debt has been validated by me. 

Please send this information to my address listed above and accept this letter, sent certified mail and via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as my formal debt validation request, which I am allowed under the FDCPA. Please note that withholding the information you received from any medical provider in an attempt to be HIPAA compliant can be a violation of the FDCPA because you will be deceiving me after my written request. I request full documentation of what you received from the provider of service in connection with this alleged debt. Additionally, any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus prior to allowing me to validate it is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which can allow me to seek damages from a collection agency. I will await your reply with above requested proof. Upon receiving it, I will correspond back by certified mail.

The auto loan has a finance charge of {$9300.00} at 4.99 % annual percentage rate ( APR ). Payments for the car loan was agreed between myself and the XXXX XXXX dealership to start on XX/XX/XXXX for my first payment. 
According to the contract signed, per the XXXX XXXX and Payments clause, the finance charge is calculated on a daily basis at the annual percentage rate on the unpaid part of the amount financed. Mind you my contract was agreed and signed by both parties to start on XX/XX/XXXX. Meaning, payment for my loan would start on XX/XX/XXXX. The Finance Charge and Payments clause also states, that, XXXX days after a payment is due as originally scheduled or deferred, TFS will compute and charge interest on any balance remaining unpaid, including any unpaid default charges or deferment charges at the annual percentage rate ( I am assuming Toyota Financial Services expects payments for car loans, middle of each month ). 

Here is the issue I have with TFS and the dealership : XXXX. Having called Toyota Financial Services, I was told over the phone that the dealership included a {$7.00} daily late charge cover up in my contract. This was revealed to me and not included in my contract. 
XXXX. Toyota Financial Services started pushing the amount finance ( car loan ) up daily by applying charges on the loan prior to the contract start date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) despite having not defaulted on any payment or the contract starting as agreed by both parties. 
XXXX. By applying interest/late charges on the amount financed ( car loan ), the amount I borrowed from Toyota is now skyrocketing on a daily even before the contract is supposed to kick in. 
XXXX. This manipulation and coercion tactic by TFS stressed me into making an untimely payment on XX/XX/XXXX for my first payment thereby, in believing the payment would affect the amount financed ( principal ). 
XXXX. After 4 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) of my first car note payment, the amount paid has and did not reflect on the principal amount prior to the bank holiday and the finances amount keeps going again.",,TOYOTA MOTOR CREDIT CORPORATION,IL,62002,,Consent provided,Web,2022-12-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6363100

165861,2023-03-08,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"1 ) I bought 2 tickets on XXXX XXXX in early XXXX for my wife and I to travel to XXXX, from XXXX. I purchased them online through their website. 
XXXX ) I used my Venture Capital One Credit card. ( but they tell me Visa company is responsible for outcome of decisions, not them ) XXXX ) XXXX notified me of a flight time change for the upcoming XX/XX/2023 summer trip I am referring to. This flight time change created more than a 5 hour change in our schedule. Additionally, the new flight times meant we'd miss our connecting flights in XXXX, taking us back to XXXX, coming back from XXXX. So, XXXX told us that they would refund our money back to our credit card, since we could no longer use the flights we purchased. Even though the were non refundable, due to the change in times, we were allowed the refund to our credit card, as you'll see in their 'refund back to the credit card ' policy shows they must do this. 
XXXX ) Based XXXX 's statements and direction, I purchased two new tickets with another airline that fit our scheduled time frame. 
XXXX ) However, XXXX ended up creating vouchers at a later time, and lying to the credit card company in our dispute, saying we requested them. Then they showed Visa a policy that everyone signs for a non refundable ticket. This is illegal, and even goes against their refund policy, and the the FAA Homeland Security policy about changing flight times and forcing passengers to accept their changes : no matter what agreements are signed when you buy a ticket ; the law says that airlines can not keep money, after they market a flight with a time to it - and then change the times dramatically. They can't make passengers find different flights, after they changed their flight times. 
XXXX ) I disputed the charge. Capital One has told us that they agree with us, that our documentation was sufficient to a refund. Even XXXX 's policy allows it. We gave 15 documents. XXXX responded a 2nd time after Capital One agreed with us and credit are account, XXXX said they gave us vouchers and we agreed to that in our non refundable tickets. The credit card person, XXXX, Employ ID XXXX with Capital One Disputes was the last person dealing with this. We have not even received any reasoning why they sided with XXXX. 
XXXX ) The people who make these decisions are "" Visa '' and not Capital One, they told us, and they are neglecting the law, at the expense of cardholders. I gave multiple documents showing my initial phone calls asking where my credit was. If someone requested conversations in those calls, which are taped, they'd hear their agents confirm refund to credit card refund would happen. Then about 10 days later they changed their minds. Flights may have been found later to take us back to XXXX, after a 4 hour flight change from XXXX- but not at the time they told us we would get a refund to our credit card. 

I need our money back. This is not fair. My wife and I never wanted vouchers, never agreed to them. We relied on our credit card company to find the insanity in XXXX 's actions. They did not. They just took a document from XXXX and did not apply the law. It's very clear : the airline changed the flight times, and left us with no flight available to connect with. The flight changes were well past the 5 hours total flight change guidelines.

The problem is that Visa did not consider the law, and only referred to a lie from the airline. I didn't sign an agreement saying you can 'change my flight times and I agree to a voucher '' when it's over 5 hours. And if they had that disclaimer, the law still trumps that. This is a clear case of a bad actor- XXXX is a horrible company, and although I complained to the FAA, no response has been made back to me. They are not honest people. I also sent them a letter, with no response. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX Finally, Capital One and Visa also used some horrible timing issues. They said that we also missed our 'time ' to respond on one case, but in fact, all the documents I uploaded were identified for both cases. Thus, when they agreed with us on one of the ticket cases, they denied us on the other case because they did not use the documents uploaded for both cases. But then at the end, we lost both cases, and they won't tell us why? Other than the merchant they agree with and vouchers were given. Come on, if I take someone's money, change the product and then give them gift certificates, that is not what the law says. It says "" refund. '' Please return my money back to me. The credit card company is wrong taking money on behalf of a fraudulent merchant, who breaks the law. I uploaded the documents to the dispute file, showing the change of flight emails, and the lack of flights available. XXXX does not even dispute changing our flight times. The credit card company should not accept that vouchers were sufficient. I have more documents I uploaded to Capital One, but the main ones are attached here. 

Please help. We can't afford two trips to XXXX, and Capital One and Visa company is not using the laws that were designed to project consumers.

Today XX/XX/XXXX my card was not working for available funds in my account. I call fraud department and they told me the block ( to confirm my attempted charge ) was removed off my account and that it was active. I had 3 more instances of calling in to unlock my card in which I had no success resolving that. It wasnt until a rep finally told me I had an additional block that required loss and prevention to remove. Upon calling loss and prevention on XX/XX/XXXX I was greeted by a very XXXX  rep who deflected my integrity and told me that I never spoke to a fraud department rep about reinstating my account for the unauthorized activity that took place. She continued to get louder and louder as I stayed calm asking for her to check any possibly notations. The rep then replied to me nope nope nope you did not even speak to anyone. This is deflecting my literal experience as a wells Fargo customer, as I DID speak with a representative who assured me my account was reinstated and active with no blocks. She continued to tell me that I never spoke to anyone in the past, even though all calls are recorded and notated.

I complain about two following things - 1 ) I didn't get the welcome bonus from American Express even though I already spend the required amount of money in the required timeframe ( {$4000.00} in 6 months ). This is a very severe problem that the bank record is not aligned with my personal spending record and they are not willing to share further detail. 

Here are the details : - The account started on XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the welcome bonus, if I spend {$4000.00} in 6 months, I am qualified to get XXXX points. 
- I tracked my spending ( see attachment ) and it clearly shows that I spent more than {$4000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
- I also talked to customer service people 3 times. Each time they mentioned that they can also see I spent more than {$4000.00} on their end. However, the final decision is made by the "" complaint team ''. Based on the investigation from the complaint team, I am not qualified, without any further reason. 

2 ) Bad service : I tried to resolve through customer service 3 times, each time the customer service people can see I spent more than {$4000.00}. But the investigation result from the "" complaint team '' still tells me I'm not qualified. 
Also, on the last complaint, I filed on XX/XX/XXXX. They said the manager will call me back with a final response within 48 hours.

As a result of that decision, our administrator, XXXX XXXX, was going to provide each of us with documentation for signatures to have the agency account holdings managed by TCF as well. She explained that since we elected this course of action, that the investment officer would contact us individually to determine our investment objectives. We were all excited to have our funds invested together and all signed the documents on XX/XX/XXXX. My sister who was handling all the correspondence spoke with the administrator of the accounts on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss some of my parents other accounts and discussed a question regarding my mothers will from our attorney. You will see on the documentation provided that Huntington signed off as personal representative of the estate, as well 4 of us beneficiaries, naming my sister the sole personal representative. As of XX/XX/XXXX no individual IRA 's set up. XXXX was emailed asking for the the documentation for the agency accounts that were supposed to be set up. She stated she would review and have the documentation to us by the holidays ( attached email ). This was the last response from our XXXX until my sister went into the bank nearly five months later. XX/XX/XXXX Emailed XXXX for the status of the investment accounts and if she would prefer we speak with our investment officer, no response. XX/XX/XXXX A call was placed to the investment officer and a voicemail was left. No correspondence from anyone at the bank. In XX/XX/XXXX, we were informed by our attorney that the investment officer that was supposed to be handling our funds hadn't been employed by the bank for several months. ( my understanding is that occurred during the transition from TCF to Huntington ). The statements that were still being sent to my mother ( who passed 6 months prior ), have had 4 different investment officers since her passing. XX/XX/XXXX My sister had emailed XXXX to discuss cost basis while preparing my deceased mothers tax returns. No response was ever received. XX/XX/XXXX We decided as a family to close out our accounts since we couldn't get Huntington to follow through with setting up our accounts, we couldn't access our funds, and we couldn't even get any responses from XXXX, who should have been acting in our best interest. XX/XX/XXXX My sister went into the XXXX XXXX, MI XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked to close out the accounts. My sister was directed to the branch manager, XXXX XXXX, to close out the accounts that he could and he did provide excellent service. He called in XXXX XXXX and the two of them explained that XXXX XXXX would need to close out the IRA and Agency accounts at which time they looked at XXXX 's calendar and set up an appointment for my sister to meet her on XX/XX/XXXX. My sister met with XXXX at XXXX XXXX branch. Expressed intentions to close out both accounts. It was very clear. She understood. She said she would calculate the cost basis but it would not be in the next couple days, rather the first of the following week. I was expecting paperwork that showed our intentions and we would liquidate. At no time did she advise me to let my siblings know that they had to e-mail her with their intentions. XX/XX/XXXX My sister emailed XXXX to request packets for signatures - no response ( see attached ). XX/XX/XXXX Sister call XXXX XXXX ( because she was helpful previously ) to see if she could check on the status. She forwarded the email to XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX She was very responsive and said that XXXX would be working on the cost basis over the weekend and to follow-up the next week ( see attached ). XX/XX/XXXX Another email to XXXX imploring her to get us the paperwork. She said she would have the cost basis finished up later that day and would give my sister a call ( see attached ) - no call, no email, no response. XX/XX/XXXX Another email from my sister asking that XXXX contact her - no response ( no email, no call ). XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX asking her contact us and asked her a couple questions. - no response. XX/XX/XXXX My sister called XXXX because he was so professional and gave great service and he got a hold of XXXX and she said she would call me that afternoon.Unapologetically received a call and she had indicated she had about finished the cost basis. I indicated I wanted this done. I asked if this was common practice to hold a deceased taxpayers funds for nine months? I asked why we did the transfer on death when that was not occurring? I asked for an explanation and was not given one. I asked about the lost funds and she said she would check with her supervisor but would most likely not have an answer next day. It was at that point she said that she would send us an e-mail with instructions and that each beneficiary would need to e-mail back their intention. XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX  no email. @ XXXX eamil from XXXX with instructions ( see emails ). XX/XX/XXXX We were finally able to get our holdings sold. We never would have sold on one of the worst day of the market except for the fear that Huntington had already been holding our funds for 9 months without us having any access and no one contacting us. We felt we had no choice and we had requested XXXX to refund us the losses from XXXX, which are approximately $ XXXX, since that is when we requested to have the funds disbursed. XX/XX/XXXX My sister emailed XXXX regarding additional questions and received no response. XX/XX/XXXX My sister contacted her supervisor, XXXX XXXX, explained what had been occurring, he stated he was unaware and would look into it and get back with my sister. XX/XX/XXXX My sister had stated she hadn't hear back from anyone on a previous email sent on XX/XX/XXXX, so that one along with all others had been sent to XXXX, in addition she had told him how we had inquired to XXXX about the reimbursement of lost funds. XX/XX/XXXX Email from XXXX stated he had made initial calls on XX/XX/XXXX and had to make further calls today XX/XX/XXXX but should have a response to my sister on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed and said that XXXX had followed proper protocol and that bank policy was followed. XX/XX/XXXX My sister responded back asking multiple questions and advised of our concerns. We really questioned if it was banks policy to no set up accounts, to not follow through on emails and to not allow us access to our funds? XX/XX/XXXX - My sister and XXXX talked and he asked her for a timeline of the events as he felt that XXXX possibly didn't follow protocol. She said she would be happy to do a timeline of events but she would like a week to get it completed. XX/XX/XXXX I had emailed XXXX to find out when the funds from the IRA where going to be put into my account that I set up with another financial institution in the middle of XX/XX/XXXX. I advised that a tracking number was provided to me from the other investment company that Huntington received on XXXX @ XXXX XXXX and signed by an individual with the last name XXXX. I was told that the IRA funds could not be disbursed until all of my siblings accounts were set up, which was being worked on. I was not certain why I couldn't receive my funds and that was the only answer provided. She also included in that email that the agency funds ( those from XXXX ) distribution was being cut that day and would be shipped overnight via XXXX. Those funds did arrive the next day. XX/XX/XXXX My sister sent a very detailed guideline ( much of what I have followed ) included all emails, paperwork and documents. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX acknowledged my sisters email and said he wouldn't be able to really devote the time until tomorrow and over the weekend but would connect with her to give her a status update. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed my sister to state the following : I have a follow up meeting scheduled late next Monday afternoon to talk further about your request with our fiduciary team. I appreciate you sending me the additional information and I will update you again next week. XX/XX/XXXX my sister wrote him back thanking him. XX/XX/XXXX My sister emailed the following to XXXX ; Hope you are doing well. I understand these things take time, but just wanted to let you know that I havent heard anything yet from the XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX My sister emailed XXXX and XXXX the following : Hi XXXX and XXXX, Can one of you please let us know the status of our reimbursement request? XX/XX/XXXX XXXX responded the following ; Huntington was XXXX on your mothers Transfer on XXXX XXXX account, meaning after your mothers passing Huntington takes direction from the beneficiaries on the account. Direction from all beneficiaries to sell out of holdings occurred on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, after the market close. Trades were placed on the next trading day, Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. Huntington acted as soon as possible after receiving direction and is not responsible for any change in value of the account, whether positive or negative, that preceded the receipt of direction from you all. XX/XX/XXXX I responded to XXXX the following : Hello XXXX, I sent an email last week with a few questions but after reviewing your email I have additional concerns I want answered.First, my name is XXXX. In addition to my sister XXXX XXXX, are my sisters XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and my brother, XXXX. I would appreciate you address us by name and not categorize us as et al. My concern is that you don't recognize us as individuals.I expect the following questions to be answered : If Huntington was supposed to be acting on the direction of all beneficiaries then why were our original accounts not set up as directed by all of us on XX/XX/XXXX? Why did no one from Huntington contact us regarding what risk tolerance we wanted set up on our investments? Certainly, someone in their XXXX or XXXX is going to invest quite differently than someone in their XXXX. Once again that was requested by all of us on XX/XX/XXXX, at which time, Huntington, who was supposed to be acting on our direction, should have completed. 
I would also like to know how we were supposed to be able to access our funds? Multiple attempts on our part went unanswered by Huntington. 
This is one question that is really concerning to me and that is why Huntington decided to not allow us access to our funds for 8 months? 
Why were we never provided with any disclosures, such as the CRS Relationship Summary, Customer Agreement, Brokerage Disclosures, Terms & Conditions, Schedule of Fees, Privacy Notice, and the Right to Opt Out, to name a few. 
Why were we each of us not provided with a copy of the investment statement monthly, or at least quarterly? Since the account is now that of the beneficiaries, it would seem as though you should have been providing one to each of us. 
I would also like to request a breakdown of how any and all fees were applied since my mother 's passing on XX/XX/XXXX. Including any trades or transactions in which we paid fees. I would like responses to these questions and a resolution by Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. Please be certain to cc all of my siblings. If no response is received I will be contacting the SEC, FINRA, XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as the NASAA State Regulator. Could you please confirm if your XXXX # XXXX is accurate? I would also like a phone number that our attorney can contact since all of this is time sensitive. 
XX/XX/XXXX Response from XXXX : XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, Let me start with an apology. I am sorry if I offended you with the salutation used in my last email. No offense was intended. Distribution checks are being sent today via XXXX  to the institutions each of you provided, and made payable as each of you has instructed. 
( This section contains dollar amounts of our distributions and each of our XXXX  tracking # 's. ) Copies of past monthly statements will be provided and will show fees and charges since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX and/or her Service Specialist XXXX XXXX will be providing those next week.The CRD # you listed WAS my CRD # when I was a Registered Representative earlier in my career and affiliated with a broker/dealer. However, it is no longer applicable as my current position within the XXXX  does not require securities licensing so I closed them out years ago.XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is copied on this email, is available as a contact for your attorney. Her phone is XXXX. I emailed XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; Hello Brad, Thank you for the follow up. We will watch for those funds to be delivered to our respective accounts. I find it unfortunate that you didn't answer many of my additional questions. I appreciate you providing XXXX 's information. 
I will attach copies of all the emails. I find it very disturbing that transactions and correspondences weren't followed through and caused us to lose money without Huntington taking any responsibility. I begin to question how many other people Huntington did this to as well. Initially, it was during a merger which makes me wonder if they were trying to pad their books and increase their portfolio. Then naturally they are going to want to have a good first quarter earnings so is that why we still couldn't have access to our funds? Was it only in XXXX when interest rates were going up and the market wasn't doing well that they were willing to part with our funds. It would be an easy way to say that is why their portfolio possibly decreased. I also question the fact of fees we were charged, yet nothing was being done with our accounts. And honestly, what kind of bank holds onto your funds from XX/XX/XXXX with multiple requests until the middle of XXXX. We never should have been denied any access to our funds and we were and it wasn't based on a lack of trying. I also, truly wonder what kind of bank doesn't give you any disclosures, where it be the arbitration agreement, account set up, fee disclosures, etc.. Huntington needs to be held responsible. This has taken a terrible strain on all of us and my parents set it up so it wouldn't be such a hassle. Huntington has created a headache, a hassle and so much stress and anxiety. I would like to know if you can please help us out and look into this further. I appreciate any and all help.

Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

872011,2022-12-22,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have been paying on my student loans since XXXX. I have worked for the same PSLF eligible employer since XX/XX/XXXX, and have sent pslf certifications every year to fedloan and now mohela. From XXXX to XXXX, I was in the 20 year repayment plan and did not realize I had to be in the XXXX program for XXXX, so I consolidated into a direct loan on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX then serviced my loan until XX/XX/XXXX when mohela got them. I then went and got a XXXX XXXX, where the final class ended XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore there were loans taken for grad school after the XXXX was consolidated. 
In XXXX, I noticed my payments were not being counted towards XXXX during the covid forbearance so I called XXXX and they said I was in in school deferment but I could fill out a form to waive it back to XX/XX/XXXX, so those payments wound count. I did this and they approved it. My counts on the loans XXXX and XXXX ( direct consolidated loans ) increased to XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I had XXXX other loans in XX/XX/XXXX with lower counts ( XXXX and XXXX with XXXX ). I called XXXX  and asked why they had different counts, and they explained that they were taken at different times. I asked if I had to consolidate them and they said no under the pslf waiver they were ok because they are all direct loans. 
In XXXX mohela got my file and since it has been a mess. In XXXX, I sent them my XX/XX/XXXX pslf certification which they denied because it was a duplicate. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent them a message asking if I needed to do anything about the varying payment counts so they would be forgiven when they reached XXXX payments. They responded with a message to give them 90 days to process. Sometime around XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to a rep and asked her why my payment counts were pending and not increasing and she said because the last time they were reviewed was the XX/XX/XXXX certification. I asked if there was ANYTHING I needed to do to get ALL of the loans forgiven when I reached XXXX payments and she said "" no but I suggest sending an updated XXXX XXXX ''. So I did right away, and this is STILL pending for mohela to review. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I sent mohela another message and specifically asked if I needed to consolidate before the waiver ends so the loans would be forgiven after XXXX payments. Again they responded to give 90 days to process but added the counts would be increasing and "" no further action in needed by me at this time ''. I also called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke for XXXX minutes to a rep who said no action was needed because I had all direct loans. 
Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from mohela  that they received notice i am in school status and they put ALL of my loans into in school deferment BACK to XX/XX/XXXX ( when this was already waived and completed by fed loan ). This means no covid counts would count again. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a rep who said I could waive them, after she confirmed that mohela  had the documents from fed loan and she was looking at them. Then, i asked her once I do that, and they put me back into forbearance will all of the loans be forgiven when the highest reaches XXXX payments and she said loans XXXX and XXXX would be first because they are at XXXX counts through XX/XX/XXXX ( pending mohela getting around to ever reviewing my pslf it will increase to XXXX counts through XX/XX/XXXX ). Then she said all of the other loans will have to reach XXXX payments!!! I am at XXXX payments on XXXX loans right now. This is what I have been trying to fix since then and having a very hard time getting straight answers from anyone. 
I have complained to XXXX, mohela  many times and also to senators, oags, XXXX  and on XXXX  and the bbb. I have an extensive case file with numerous documents as proof and the last few requests I sent to mohela are still processing. 
I have been asking them if I consolidate my loans now, ( since I did not due to their erroneous information said I did not need to ) would all of my counts be reset or not under the XXXX waiver. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I went onto mohela and saw that loan XXXX was gone and my balance decreased to $ XXXX from $ XXXX. There was loan XXXX left ( at XXXX pymts through XX/XX/XXXX ). I called mohela and could not wait over XXXX hours to talk to the cat rep because i had a meeting. So, XXXX  assured me that they confirmed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX that I am able to consolidate my loans and get credit for months prior to consolidation. Because I was worried that loan XXXX would be written off like loan XXXX was and then only the lower count loans would be left, and I would lose over XXXX payments and more, I filed a consolidation application today XX/XX/XXXX. 
If my payments now reset to zero and I do not get credit and all of them automatically XXXX because of mohelas error, I will consider filing a lawsuit based on principle, mental anguish and suffering in dealing with this pslf mess. 
This system is not fixed, and is probably worse with XXXX servicer getting all of the loans now. 
I have filed a feedback case with studentaid.gov that is also still pending. 
Please help me resolve this. I should not be harmed due to mohelas misinformation and lack of responding timely. Thank you",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,PA,180XX,,Consent provided,Web,2022-12-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6347380

The Chase representative advised me to disregard the pending unauthorized charge as the pending charge will not be process. Additionally, he advised my credit card would be cancelled and that I would receive a new credit card in less than 6 days. 
Two weeks later I received a letter from Chase saying that they investigated the charge and that I will have to pay for the charges because I received the service. Please understand I NEVER LEFT THE USA!! 
I immediately called Chase and was transferred to the fraud department who advised they would investigate. 
They requested documents I had That supported my claim. I complied with that request and sent a police report which supports my claim that my identity was hacked and my personal information was compromised. 
They advised that they will review and re-investigate my claim. 
One week later I received a copy of the same original later stating that it was a valid transaction because my name and email were used. ( AGAIN, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I NEVER LEFT THE USA! SO, HOW WAS THAT CHARGE POSSIBLE ) I was then advised to contact the vendor which I did. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX  and they advised they had a reservation with my name and email and asked me to contact the hotel. After contacting the hotel, I was told they had a reservation in my name but nobody checked in so they did not charge they credit card. ( PLEASE UNDERSTAND I WAS NEVER THERE AND I WAS IN THE USA!!! ) They provided me an email which stated the same. I forwarded this email to Chase Fraud. Chase Fraud advised that they would re-investigate the re-investigation. Allegedly, they conducted another investigation ( the third ) and served me with a new-old letter stating the same thing they previously sent 4 times.

Im the one who alerted Chase about the unauthorized pending charge was advised by Chase that it would not be process only to find out it was processed and now I am to blame.

One of the reasons we use a Chase credit card is because of the program they have to protect the customer against such things. It is well known that hackers have breached the data bases that support credit cards. Credit cards should have a protection with identity thief and unauthorized charges.

I never travelled outside the United States! I was in the USA the whole time.

The chargewas notmadeby me T
he charge was not made by any authorized user on the account I haven't let anyone else use my card I have asked Chase to reviewedthe fraud charge in several times.i sent a letter to the eco and corporate and they said they charges will stayed.

This information does not relate to any transactions I have made. I did not give anyone authorization or consent to use my personal information. I hereby exercise my legal rights enacted by Congress and The Federal Trade Commission, which explicitly states when a victim of identity-theft dispute a fraudulent account on his/her credit report it shall be honored by all credit bureaus and all fraudulent information should be blocked within 4 days and proper notification shall be given to all data furnishers pursuant to section 605b of The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Because I know my rights under THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT, CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION ACT ( CCPA ), and FAIR and ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTION ACT of 2003 ( FACTA ). I will be taking action. 

I also know my rights under this paragraph of Section 312 of the FACTA LAW : SEC.312. Procedures to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. ( b ) duty of furnishers to provide accurate information. -- Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) of THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) is amended ( 1 ) in subparagraph ( A ), by striking "" knows or consciously avoids knowing the information is inaccurate '' and inserting "" knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate '', and ( 2 ) by adding at the end of the following : ( D ) DEFINITION -- For purposes of subparagraph ( A ), the term 'reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate ' means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of information. 

Policy states. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy.

( a ) Reinvestigation ( 1 ) Reinvestigation ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. 

It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from my credit files. 

1. ASSETCARE LLC bal. {$870.00} 2. ASSETCARE LLC bal. {$240.00} I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity theft. 

1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from alleged identity theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date receipt by such agency of 1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to the transaction by the consumer. 

I have provided all of the above listed four ( 4 ) items within this package. Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days. This is clearly an identity theft issue. I am also entitled to receive a free copy of my credit report, so I am requesting a free credit report and that all of these accounts, public records items, and inquiries be permanently blocked and deleted.

925539,2023-02-17,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Unable to receive car title or other problem after the loan is paid off,"On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with the CFPB against Santander in reference to the difficulty Ive had obtaining the title for my vehicle after it was written off for natural disaster and coded as such on my credit reports. A {$0.00} balance and XXXX  late payment status was also reflected. 5 days after filing this complaint the natural disaster remark and indicating code ( AW ) was removed and my balance was changed to the full loan amount. 

I had a couple late payments in early XXXX due to being hospitalized for XXXX but communicated this to the CEO by finding him on XXXX when I couldnt get any help from the customer support department. I also caught up my payments until I was locked out of my account. Consequently this is about the time the info on my credit report appears to show relief. Shortly after returning home from the hospital, the vehicle began having mechanical issues that eventually made it inoperable. I purchased the extended warranty which I was told was cancelled due to my finance companys poor practices and unreliability. Therefore I couldnt have the car fixed. 

At no time was I called, emailed, sent anything in the mail or otherwise notified of any delinquency or repossession. The car sat in my driveway for months unable to move. Ive been trying to find a way to work to get the money to have it fixed and now know it cant be and must be sold. Which I need the title for. 

Yesterday I called and the first representative that answered I explained my situation too and she told me I couldnt have the title until it was paid off and hung up on me. Upon calling back I was able to obtain from the automated system a customer number, a payoff balance of $ XXXX and that the next payment of {$640.00} is due on XXXX, XXXX. As youll see from the attached documentation, clearly their records are mismanaged because I made a payment for the normal amount ( meaning it wasnt late, ) in XX/XX/XXXX. The next representative, XXXX, ID # XXXX answered my call and I again explained my situation. Very rudely he told me that the information I had was incorrect and the vehicle was in repossession status and demanded I tell him where it was. I told him that its been inoperable as reported nearly a year ago and its been written off as a natural disaster loss and XXXX balance. I again requested information on how to obtain the title so that I may move forward in the process of salvaging my equity in this vehicle and he told me I could only do that by paying off the balance of this extremely predatory loan that was made after I left the dealership, 3 states away. 

This vehicle was purchased at {$31000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX with an {$8000.00} down payment and Santanders 24.99 % interest rate brought the total financed to {$46000.00}. My credit application ( see attached ) is completely blank other than my contact info and my self employment income I reported. This is all the documentation I was asked when financed. I believe that this practice is inconsistent with the recent settlement terms in the lawsuit brought on Santander by the CFPB. 

I find this to be not only a violation of the settlement terms of this case, predatory and criminal practices and unlawful lending and contract but now extremely concerning that after filing this complaint for what is rightfully mine in the title the company deliberately changed the coding and balance on my credit reports to hinder my ability to purchase another vehicle and attempt to hide their further wrongdoing.",,"SANTANDER HOLDINGS USA, INC.",FL,32309,,Consent provided,Web,2023-02-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6584804

VIOLATION OF FDCPA AND TILA MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTONs agents are also found in violation of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for their failure to provide 2 copies of my rights of rescission ( 15 USC 1635 ) along with several other blatant omissions of material facts throughout the entire consumer transaction. This resulted in the subsequent fraudulent pilferage/obtainage of all my signatures executed in my natural and grantor capacities.

VIOLATION OF 16 CFR 444.3 - UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE COSIGNER PRACTICES The finance manager for Mercedes-benz of burlington, provided the consumer with paperwork which listed Mercedes-benz of burlingtonas seller and creditor. Your agents drew up paperwork which used deceptive language in the consumer credit application to obtain financing from MERCEDES-BENZ FINANCIAL SERVICES but no such finance was ever obtained by me as the creditor and original party to this transaction. I was then led to believe that I was the borrower when in fact I as the creditor per 15 USC 1692 ( a ) acted as cosigner for the financing received by the dealership. Furthermore, MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTONs agents did not disclose that upon I, the consumer providing the social security number ( credit card ) per the Truth in Lending Act 15 USC 1601 ( I ) the transaction was subject to 18 USC 8. Also the cardholder ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as the consumer who is the ORIGINAL CREDITOR in the consumer credit transaction was not told that credit would be used by the dealership and the financial institution MERCEDES-BENZ FINANCIAL SERVICES to obtain funding from the federal reserve bank per ( 12 USC 1431 ) in the consumer 's name, and returned as a loan which constitutes identity theft. Nothing of value was paid, no consideration from dealership MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTON or its agents was provided to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX : consumer on behalf of the Principal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [ legal fiction ] Further Violations under Massachusetts Statutory Law XXXX XXXX finance manager for the seller MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTON, stated that Power of Attorney must be granted to MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTON in order to register my household good ( s ) with the STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS on my behalf for the purpose of license plates and DMV tags verifying registration of my private automobile.This is a direct violation of Massachusettes Statutory law which states the following : Since a sale of personal property is not required to be evidenced by any written instrument in order to be valid, it has been held in Massachusetts that there may be a transfer of title to an automobile without complying with the registration statute which requires a transfer and delivery of a certificate of title. N.C. Law Review Vol. 32 page 545, Carolina Discount Corp. v. Landis Motor Co., 190 N.C. 157. The following shall be exempt from the requirements of registration and the certificate of title : 1. ) Any such vehicle driven or moved upon the highway in conformance with the provisions of this Article relating to manufacturers, dealers, or nonresidents. 2. ) Any such vehicle which is driven or moved upon a highway only for the purpose of crossing such highway from one property to another. XXXX ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( comment : not driven or moved upon the highway for transporting persons or property for profit. ) ( Case note to North Carolina G.S. 12-3 Statutory Construction ). It also further solidifies the deception as I later learned that by signing POA under duress as I was pressured to do so by her and my sales agent XXXX, that I am giving up all rights to my property which is how they would later have authority to repossess my private property if I failed to pay the monthly gift to the dealership that they deceptively term a car note They also failed to inform me that upon receiving my signature on the application which is a promissory note that the automobile would be paid in full. Instead they receive the benefits by taking POA and make me liable for a loan I would never actually receive!

Violation of The Sherman  ACT of 1890 and the Clayton ACT of XXXX Both Acts clearly prohibit and outlaw practices that are harmful to the consumer such as but not limited to, forcing the consumer into a monopoly. The STATE OF Massachusetts as confirmed by their D-U-N-S identification number XXXX is a private fictitious corporation operating as agent/agency under the UNITED STATES, a foreign entity based within the 10 mile radius of the District of Columbia. [ Acts of the Forty-first Congress, Section 34, Session III, chapters 61 and 62, ] MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTON has been found in violation of these acts by inducing me into fraudulently registering my household goods with the State, in which they too ( MERCEDES-BENZ OF BURLINGTON ) stand to profit from as outlined in the contract under fees. All these being evidence of a forced monopoly. 

Rescission Of Agreement/Contract Revocation Of Powers Of Attorney Therefore, without exception, any and all agreements, documents, and contracts between XX/XX/XXXX through the date of this Actual and Constructive Notice through to the date of my natural death, issued to me or the Principal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [ legal fiction ], in all matters are considered void for failure to disclose information and because such lack of disclosure could otherwise result in long term financial damages to me as the consumer and further subject me to involuntary servitude which is a direct violation Thirteenth Amendment ( Amendment XIII ) to the United States Constitution.

All unconscionable contracts are subject to rescission under the common law as well Federal law as evidenced by 15 U.S. Code 1635 for failure to make the proper disclosures in order to constitute an acceptance. Where there is no meeting of the minds there is no contract as required by 226.23 ( b ) ( 1 ) regarding notice of right to rescind as set forth in re XXXX v.

11322,2023-07-13,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"A quick background on me : my wife and I are near retirement age. We each have credit scores of over 800. We ALWAYS pay our XXXX credit card bills each month. We own our house. We are very secure financially. 

So why do I write this letter? To call out a large financial institution that chooses to work against the best interest of their customers. 

Here 's what happened : Two years ago I went into overdraft on my Citibank Checking "" Plus '' account. I believe this overdraft occured when I moved money into my son 's college account. I'm guessing the account was in deficit for less than XXXX XXXX 

Here 's my problem : I believe that Citibank uses a highly suspect business practice. Even when my account bounced back into positive territory a day or so later ( and averaged approximately {$20000.00} for many years ), the bank chose not to notify me in a meaningful way. They chose to gamely take my money, {$1400.00} in interest, for over two years. And they would still be charging me interest if I didn't happen to stumble upon this outstanding debt. 

My question is : WHY ISN'T THE CONSUMER NOTIFIED WHEN INTEREST IS ACCRUING AGAINST THEM? Credit card and mortgage statements are very clear about notifying the customer, giving them options for payment. Why should CITI get a free pass here? Shouldn't the consumer ALWAYS be notified if they're in arrears? When I say "" notify, '' this means a SPECIFIC notification, not just a monthly statement with interest accruing charges unseen by me for 2 years. 

When I wrote CITI 's corporate headquarters, they 1 ) flatly refused to discuss any compromise or refund, and 2 ) muddied the waters by denying that this practice was "" discriminatory. '' ( Very strange - I never accused them of discriminating against me. ) What they pointed me to was a single line item, "" Checking Plus '', at the VERY bottom of my home landing page. Well, I NEVER look at this remote place online. When I go online to my CITI account, I see my account at the top, and I click on it to do my online bill paying, etc. I don't scroll down to a line item ( that I didn't even know I had! ) Why can't they be required to notify their customers that they're in arrears on overdraft interest? Why can't a letter or email go out? Why can't a banner appear at the top of the online account page? Why not a message alert? I think I know why, it would lose this megabank lots of easy money! 

I ask that the CFPB do a deep dive into CITI 's overdraft policies. I believe they are designed to reap a steady flow of well-disguised interest charges from unsuspecting customers. 

Thank you very much.

All of these communication attempts were not successful. The problem began XXXX months ago. At the time, I had XXXX credit cards with Chase Bank. that would be this card, and Chase XXXX Business Preferred Card. But what occurred was as follows. Following XXXX larger purchases, XXXX for a rent payment of {$1100.00} and another for a computer purchase, around {$630.00}. It was advertised on their site, that I could elect a "" my chase plan ''. With this plan, I would be paying these charges off, over 6 or 12 months. at the time, I thought this was a good idea. I did not know how wrong I would be. 

The balances were never taken off of the full principal balances, as advertised. Also, nowhere in their language on their website, did it indicate that once signed up for, the "" My Chase Plan '' can not EVER be reversed. I tried to do this several times, to no avail. I spoke to a rep there, then supervisors. I spoke to a supervisor in XXXX. This manager stated "" You can find a balance transfer card, if you would like, to avoid the interest charges that will accrue. I did this after my last wedding. I said 'interest charges, nope ' '' He actually said that. Later that next week, I spoke to another supervisor, who refused to undo the my chase plans. With these two my chase plans, I could no longer afford to pay my minimum payments. In effect, the payments were now about {$390.00} in total. 
I had asked them about payment assistance. They would not offer me that number, ever, so I could contact them directly. Again, the party line became, we can not reverse these my chase plans, sorry. I submitted an executive complaint, with them, and with my local branch, in XXXX XXXX, CA. I got a call XXXX days later, that again, they could do nothing to reverse the charges or plans on this account. But it gets worse here! 

The branch was nicer, much nicer. But after the executive complaint process, that credit line was cut, like immediately, in retaliation for the complaints. I had to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX about this issue, and apply for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. That reduced the monthly payment to {$190.00}, but I can not even afford that, with my rent being so high ( $ XXXX ). Just this Sunday, I learned that the Chase XXXX card had been cancelled as well. I spoke to a supervisor on that day, who stated that I was a "" high risk '' and that b/c of the DMP, this credit line was closed, and could not be re-opened. 

so... Here I am submitting this complaint. I have been totally broke, and overdrawn since Sunday. I almost actually had a XXXX the other day, on an errand to go get food. And had to go to the ER yesterday. They did XXXX CTs and blood tests to rule out a transient ischemic XXXX. I am not kidding when I say this has all created a ton of XXXX for me, both financially and emotionally. Now, did I spend too much on these cards= YES. Was I irresponsible at times? Yes, I was. And that is what I told the branch. But as of now, I will not be able to make the next XXXX Payment. 

All of this comes back to the unfair business practice of the My Chase Plan. If it had not been for that, I would have been able to make my minimum payments, and been out of trouble. These people at JP Chase Morgan and the credit card departments, specifically, have no interest in helping consumers out. AT ALL! They are XXXX. I wanted to submit this complaint. I am facing bankruptcy, at this point. This has really messed up my health as well. I want others to know what happened to me.

It was order # XXXX. The total purchase was {$390.00}. The purse arrived two days later and I immediately decided to return it- it was not quite what I had expected. I returned it exactly according to Saks procedure, and my account indicated several days later that the return had been received. To date, despite many, many, many phone calls and emails to both Saks and Capital One, I have not been issued a credit. I have received verbal and written apologies for the delay and assurances that the credit would be posted, but there is still no credit. Since the beginning of the pandemic, this is not the first time that I have experienced unreasonable delays in receiving credit from Saks for items purchased on line and then returned. It seems they are trying very hard to hold onto my money as long as possible, but two months and two billing cycles is inexcusable. And I STILL do not have my credit. Anything you can do to help me would be deeply appreciated. And if you choose to publish this information, I would certainly be OK with that because Saks needs to know that customers find this practice completely and utterly unacceptable and unethical. I am attaching a copy of an email from Saks on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that they are sorry for the delay and that a credit would be posted. I received my newest statement from Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. There was no credit. I called Capital One and they said to wait a week to see if the credit would be posted. It has now been ten more days, still no credit. Meanwhile, I am making only minimum payments on this card because I truly do NOT owe anything to Saks.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 1.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file.

In attempting to foreclose on the property, BNY Mellon intentionally forged the legal description on the Court documents publicizing the auction instead of reforming the mortgage as it is required to do, by law and which resulted in a grossly inadequate bid price. 

Further, in an effort to settle the matter, I attempted, on multiple occasions, to satisfy the entire foreclosure judgment. BNY Mellon refused to accept full payment and instead accepted almost half of the judgment amount from a known collusive bidder in a grossly faulty foreclosure auction. 

After BNY Mellon forged Court filed documents to avoid correcting the mortgage, it then maliciously prevented me from satisfying the judgment, retaining the equity in my home, and satisfying the judgment to avoid a completed foreclosure. They also conspired with the auction bidder to prevent my right to due process and hearing of my timely objections to the faulty foreclosure auction. 

I have raised these issues in a multi-year court battle ; yet BNY Mellon continues to engage in knowingly malicious bad acts. They have admitted their errors in XXXX documents, yet they refuse to take corrective actions. It is unacceptable and must be addressed.

Penn Corp 's response to my first complaint mentioned a name that was not mine ( someone by the name of XXXX XXXX, which is not me ) and said they would resolve this, which they did not and have violated several of my consumer rights. 

A medical collection ( that I was never notified was going to be sent to collections ) showed up on my credit report and negatively impacted my credit. I sent out a certified debt validation letter on XX/XX/2022 to Penn Credit Corporation requesting they validate this debt, per my right under the FDCPA. Penn Credit Corporation received this letter on XX/XX/2022 ( according to the USPS tracking ) and per the FCRA they have 30 days to respond to my request from the date they receive this letter and they DID NOT respond at all. Since they did not respond, all references to this account MUST be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request must be sent to me immediately, per my letter. 

Now since they IGNORED this FIRST debt validation letter. I sent them a failure to validate the debt letter on XX/XX/2022 informing them they failed to validate this debt at my request and CONTINUE to report a DISPUTED DEBT to the Credit Bureaus which is a FDCPA and FCRA violation so that's TWO VIOLATIONS. 

They had 15 days from the date of receiving my second letter to respond. They received the letter on XX/XX/2022 ( according to their SIGNED USPS receipt ) and completely ignored this SECOND letter which means I reserve the right to sue this company for violations of my consumer rights as specified under both the FDCPA and the FCRA. I may also seek damages from them if warranted. 

I have provided all receipts and images.

1883587,2023-04-13,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"Hello, I am writing to dispute several violations of federal laws committed by the creditor regarding my credit report. I am extremely frustrated and emotionally distressed due to the negative impact these violations have had on my life. 

My correct name is XXXX XXXX but bureaus are reporting it as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Also my current address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Kansas XXXX, But bureau reported that I have many addresses like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KS XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KS XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX KS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NH XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NH XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX And My Wrong Employers is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The creditor has reported inaccurate information on my credit report, including multiple addresses that I have never lived at. These inaccuracies have affected my credit score, and have made it difficult for me to obtain credit and loans at reasonable rates. The creditor has violated several federal laws including : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) - This section requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information in a consumer 's credit report. The inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1692e - This section prohibits debt collectors from using false, deceptive, or misleading representations in the collection of a debt. Reporting inaccurate addresses may be a violation of this section if the debt collector knew or should have known that the information was false or misleading. 
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) - 15 U.S.C. 6821 - This section requires businesses to implement reasonable policies and procedures to protect sensitive consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure. The failure to protect sensitive consumer information resulting in inaccurate reporting of multiple addresses may be a violation of this section. 
Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. - This law requires lenders to provide borrowers with certain disclosures about credit terms and costs. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of TILA, it may be a violation if the incorrect reporting is tied to an inaccurate disclosure of credit terms or costs. 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) - 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. - This law requires mortgage lenders to provide certain disclosures to borrowers and prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks for referrals. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of RESPA if it is tied to a failure to provide required disclosures or if it is tied to a kickback scheme. 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq. - This law prohibits lenders from discriminating against borrowers on the basis of certain protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or age. Reporting incorrect addresses could be a violation of ECOA if it results in a lender using inaccurate information to make a discriminatory decision. 
Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1666 et seq. - This law requires credit card issuers to provide certain billing error resolution procedures to cardholders. While the reporting of multiple addresses is not a direct violation of the FCBA, it could be a violation if it is tied to a failure to properly handle a billing error dispute. 
These violations have caused me significant financial harm and emotional distress. I have been denied credit and loans, and have been forced to pay higher interest rates due to the inaccurate reporting. It has also caused me significant stress and XXXX as I feel like my financial security and future opportunities have been compromised. 

I request that you enforce the legal provisions that have been violated, and that the creditor be required to remove the unverified accounts from my credit report. I also request that the creditor be held accountable for the financial and emotional harm they have caused me. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

The renters left without notice and left us trying to pay the mortgage. We had to sell our property under value because that mortgage company was trying to foreclose on that house. We voluntarily stopped the forbearance and agreed to go on a modification plan to put the owed amount on the back of the loan and make regular payments. We paid the three months trial to show that we could make payments. From XX/XX/XXXX up to XX/XX/XXXX for our primary residence, but for our rental property they stopped accepting our payments and just told us they are just going to proceed and expedite with foreclosure even though we were making the payments. We have been making our payments on time waiting for the company to send the modification packages to establish a firm payment history. Instead, the mortgage company kept sending expired forms to fill out and notarize and several of their reps said not to fill them out because they were expired. The mortgage company then changed the verbally agreed modification that would not benefit us and was supposed to send corrected forms. Instead, they put it on our credit report that we were late on our payments and not making payments at all. when they said they would not, and now they are trying to foreclose on our home after they ruined our credit it is so low we can not do a refinance anywhere and missed the deadline for the government modification plans.

I have tried multiple times to dispute this with both XXXX and with Ford Motor Credit to no avail. With my last attempt to dispute this, I explained in a very detailed manner why and what was at issue to the XXXX personnel, and they said the report was updated BUT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. 

I have run out of options. Despite my otherwise decent credit report and attempting to do the right thing in this circumstance, the recency of this alleged charge-off has prevented me from obtaining any other forms of credit that I very much need to acquire ( an auto loan, and a debt consolidation loan- both rejected because of this erroneous and punitive charge-off entry in my credit report ).",,FORD MOTOR CREDIT CO.,NY,120XX,,Consent provided,Web,2022-01-28,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5158345

We were grateful.

I asked my wife to call them and ask if there was a problem.

I continued to receive these automated calls over the following weeks so I called XXXX personally to ask them to stop calling. At this point the representative informed me that the payment pause was only for one month and if we wanted to extend it we would have needed to call in again. This was absolutely not made clear at the time of the pause. and then on top of that, we were told to ignore the late payment calls. How are we supposed to know if a XXXX representative is telling us accurate information or not? We made the mistake of assuming they were giving us credible information and we ended up being hit with a 30 day late note on our reports.

Ironically speaking, on XXXX XXXX, on or about these dates, my account had finally been credited for two other payments that had also previously been disputed. At that time I was told to be sure to complete the forms that were to be sent to me, and return them as soon as possible. As time went on, there were no forms that arrived in the mail, only XXXX different debit cards, two of which I had never requested. It wasnt until after the previous complaint was filed that got the attention of XXXX, of US Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Office of the President, who responded to the complaint by sending me documents regarding the prior complaint that notified me that the credit was granted and that it would be final, but also the documents that were never sent regarding the provisional credits that were issued on XXXX XXXX? Now mind you, the documents that were included in the packet were not only inclusive of the resolution regarding the complaint sent to your agency, but the documents that were supposed to have been sent weeks ago regarding the claims for the provisional credits that were given at the beginning of XXXX! The letter was dated XX/XX/2022 mentioned, the post mark on the outside of the envelope was dated XX/XX/2022, but the correspondence that pertained to the previous provisional credits issued the beginning of XXXX, stated that after the forms were completed they were to be sent back and received by them by XX/XX/XXXX. ( the very next day ) or the credits would be reversed! In whos reality does this exist? Certainly not in mine. First and foremost, I never received the packet until XX/XX/XXXX and at that time I did as I was instructed to do. Without any warning, on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I withdrew XXXX $ from my account at XXXXXXXX XXXX. and at that time my balance was as it should have been. It wasnt until approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX. that I checked my balance and the credits had been reversed resulting in a negative balance depleting my account leaving me with a negative {$680.00}! causing checks to be returned and essentially nothing at all to pay bills, get gas or food. Not only that, but the order in which things were done were not only deliberate and insulting but were done in direct retaliation because of the complaint that was filed about the claim that they had previously denied. It is obvious that the documents that were sent to me on the 15th, were not going to arrive in enough time to be returned by the XXXX. because they were sent through the regular mail and not overnight express. I have the envelope that has the postmark as well as the documents that were dated XX/XX/XXXX, requesting that they be returned by the 16th. Absolutely absurd. I have suffered an extremely emotional and financial crisis as a result of the recent deliberate unacceptable events. I am deeply concerned about the actions of a company that claims to be concerned about XXXX Veterans, which my husband proudly is but given the most recent unethical behavior that has been disclosed involving US Bank employees and unsuspecting customers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,OH,45231,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2022-10-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6056524

This was around first week when XXXX was opened air travel during coronovirus epidemic During purchase process and on their website ( XXXX ) there was no information for any additional requirements. 
I also tried to reach them ( XXXX XXXX  ) on the phone to get information for any possible restriction/requirements for traveling to XXXX during coronovirus specially this first week XXXX government opens air traveling to the country, but i was not able to reach anyone on the phone. 
I heard from a traveling person ( to an other country ) that some countries are requiring Covid 19 test. 
I went to XXXX and got a Covid -19 test incase it might make my travel less complicated. 
When i try to fly on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX aiport, I was told in check in desk that i can not fly not only without Covid 19 - PCS test. that time i found out test that i had was not PCR test. I noticed no one else was presenting COVID 19 test during check in nor any sign or information around check in area indicates test requirements. 
Later i learned this was because XXXX  citizen living in USA are not required to have a test. it seems to me because almost everyone flying that time was XXXX  citizen, airlines did not bother to post the covid19 test requirement information for others.

I was denied flight but offered cancellation of airplane or change of flight date within 3 days of original ticket.

Knowing i can not get Covid 19 PCR test very quick, i asked for cancellation. Person in check in said they can not cancel ticket at their computer but he will put my request in system but i have to reach their customer service on the phone to complete cancellation. He also said he is changing my flight for next day in case i did get Covid 19 pcr test. It made sense to me and i left the airport. In next several weeks i tried to reach XXXX XXXX via phone chat social media even called them their customer service in XXXX but they never got back to me in mails or voice messages. On their customer service phone number, in prerecording options they ask to press for different department if inquiry is for Cancellation/refunds. then no one is available only can leave voice message. after over 1 month not getting hold of anyone for refund i contacted my credit card company, BANK OF AMERICA.. About month later i received deny letter from the bank reads : "" We understand you weren't satisfied with the quality of the service the merchant provided ; however the merchant has the right to request payment for any services that were rendered "" problem is i was not rendered any services. Same like you order something online but you didnt receive then you contact merchant to report but they do not respond. what happens in that case? is this just because you are not happy with their quality of service I explained to bank of America again on the phone but they seem to listen then say they will forward information to proper department to investigate. i am not able to discuss this with a bank representative who is actually handling the issue themselves. it seems they are only filling a form on computer to forward an other department which is overs implied and does not represent details of the case.

I tried for 2 to 3 months to get the bank to cooperate with getting the old liens removed because I was awarded a XXXX program award of {$50000.00} to bring my mortgage current but they notified me that supposedly I had 3 liens against my property at that time and I had to get it remedied before they would give me final approval. I had to accomplish that before 2 months. Bank of America would not respond to me. I finally got through to them by utilizing the new loan line and convincing personnel to transfer me continuously until I reached the right person who started to help me get the previous liens removed. By the time it was accomplished it was too late and due to their negligence and direct inhibiting me from accomplishing it in a timely fashion I lost the {$50000.00} XXXX award. Then I was guided into a different process by Bank of America which was significantly detrimental in its financial effects compared to the XXXX program that I was awarded and then lost due to Bank of America 's negligence. Since the inception of that modification plan I have made really no financial progress after making payments on time and consistently from XXXX to XXXX. After the bank lawsuits and the Colorado Attorney General received money to these matters which involved direct wrongdoing also with Bank of America such as them stopping me making payments for 13 months while being unable to speak as to why, the Attorney General merely responded to me saying they were too busy to help me. With the evidence that I provided them at the time they would have likely resolved the matter quickly and likely for the bank 's actions against me would have resulted in the bank turning over the deed of trust and canceling the mortgage. This statement is made supported by other actual cases that were on point with the circumstances that I was dealing with Bank of America at that time. Still the Attorney General of Colorado was too busy to help me. The FHA saw the issue with the liens on record that were errant on record and even told me that it was clear the old ones should not be there because they could see the more recent mortgage finance that would have automatically paid off the previous debt and released the lien. The bank has to put in for the release of lien however. The FHA rep told me with this so clear they should have honored the XXXX program whether they were cleared before or after the two month period. There are several more facts that play into this situation which demonstrate and establish fraud and wrongdoing.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 1. ERC bal. {$100.00} I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity theft. 1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from alleged identity theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date receipt by such agency of 1.

1379868,2023-05-04,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"First Issue : We purchased a XXXX property on XX/XX/XXXX with two dwellings on it : a brick ( primary ) dwelling and a mobile home ( accessory dwelling ). Both dwellings were listed for sale together. The sales contract shows that a mobile home is included ; the appraisal shows the same on 3 different pages ; the survey also shows 2 dwellings on the property. {$36000.00} of my current loan was used to pay off the initial loan for the mobile home. 

The address is different for each dwelling on the property, per county rules and regulations. The homeowners insurance carrier is different for each dwelling because we could not readily find a company that would insure both types of dwelling. Declarations pages for both policies were submitted to the initial lender, with prepayments and initial payments to both insurance companies disclosed separately at closing. 

At the first policy renewal, the mortgage company paid only the premium for the primary dwelling, citing multiple reasons over time for not adding the second company back to the escrow account. They contend that 1 ) the mobile home insurer was not included in the initial escrow statement and 2 ) there is an address mismatch, even though both dwellings are on one parcel. 

I have been calling the mortgage company since XX/XX/XXXX, when I first received an escrow account statement and a refund check, and I simultaneously received renewal declarations from primary insurer. I explained that I was confused about why I was receiving a refund, when there was still the other insurer for them to pay. I was advised to send declarations page from the primary insurer to them and send bill from the other insurer to see if it could be included in escrow. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that they were looking for the initial disclosure ; they were confirming everything with the mobile home insurer ; initial escrow was done differently ; they will need to add an additional escrow line ; by Friday everything should be updated ; they will also need to run a new analysis ; initial escrow statement is what they go by. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, another representative told me that the Insurance Department needed to rewrite the policy for the 2 dwellings on one parcel. I got transferred to someone else who asked me to upload what I had showing both addresses on the same parcel. She would transfer me to their Mortgage Customer Service for them to update the address to reflect 1 parcel with 2 addresses. The call dropped after I was transferredNo one called me back ; and when I called again, I was told that they were getting ready to generate a letter to tell me the next steps. I uploaded the Address Assignment documents from the county on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called the insurance company again on XX/XX/XXXX. This time I was told that it looked like the mobile home insurer needed to be added ; there was a task open for that already, which was expected to close on XXXX should not have to worry about the mobile home insurer not being paid, and I could call back after XX/XX/XXXX. ( I did not disclose to them that I had already paid the mobile home insurer on XX/XX/XXXX ). I received the first request from the mortgage company in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, in which they requested the most recent paid receipt for homeowners insurance declaration page ( uploaded on XX/XX/XXXX and attached ). I have attached proof of both insurance policies being included at closing and in the mortgage breakdown -- including payoff of mobile home ; proof of 2 dwellings on 1 property ( one parcel ) prior to closing ; and information sent to the mortgage company as requested in XX/XX/XXXX correspondence. 

Second Issue : Besides the mediocre customer service, run-around, and lack of resolution to date, I am appalled at the deplorable service I received when I called the mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX. I have come to know the routine by now ( after several callssometimes more than one call on a given day when the calls drop and no one calls me back, and being transferred to so many individuals ), so I was shocked when I got transferred to XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that she hung up on me around XXXX! This was not a dropped call because I had the opportunity to complete the survey. She simply did not like me asking her if they did not review what I have already uploaded ( she was asking me for documents I had already sent them ). I was not nasty to her, although I will admit that I had raised my voice ( out of frustration ) I did not yell or even get loud Shame on her! Great leaders are way more professional and patient than XXXX was. How can a supervisor or manager ( someone on the Escalation Team, of all places ) behave that way? If I had been blowing my top or using foul language, then I would not have been this shocked and upset. Even if she wanted to lie and say the call dropped, why didnt she call me back, when I had just verified my telephone numberamong other things? If she did not want to help me, she could have transferred me to someone else. I am a paying customer, who has been holding up my end of the bargain by ensuring timely payments are made. The expectation from the insurance company is that they will hire and train professionals who will do their best to resolve issues in a timely mannernot add fuel to fire.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",FL,320XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2023-05-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6924580

211480,2021-03-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a second home and financed it with a mortgage originated and services by JPMorgan Chase Bank ( loan number XXXX ). The home is located in Hawaii and is rented out by me or my on-island property manager when not being used by my family. My rate was 3.75 % for a 30 year fixed conventional mortgage. All payments have been made in a timely basis and I am in compliance with all requirements. 

In late XXXX I began a refinancing process with JPMorgan Chase and was quoted a rate of 2.875 % by my Chase broker XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). All documentation was uploaded within 24-28 hours of request. The process was moving very slowly and was told Chase was backed up on refinancings. I expected to close in XXXX and that did not happen. When I inquired I was told they were waiting for condo documents. My property is part of a condo association. I repeatedly asked for updates through the month. In late XXXX I was told that the underwriter believed my property did not qualify for refinancing due to the way the property was classified. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice of decline. The report says the decision was made based on my credit which for the record is over XXXX with ample liquid assets. My broker told me the underwriter viewed my property as a condo-tel. It is not and I explained that. It is on a resort property in Hawaii but the condo association is independent and there is no requirement ( or option ) to rent my unit out in a rental pool at the resort. I maintain my own property manager who markets it on my behalf and if I chose not to rent it that is my choice. 

By late XXXX the underlying rates in the market increased about 100 basis points from where my rate was locked. I believe Chase, in an attempt to not honor my rate, declined my refinancing for invalid reasons. I tried appealing to no avail. What I find unusual is that Chase still owns my original loan, which 14 months old. There were no changes in our condo association rules or designations and my assets and credit remain at or better than they were a year ago. 

I was hoping someone could inquire as I believe they used unfair lending practices to avoid honoring their rate commitment to me.

975118,2021-08-07,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/2020, I purchased online a XXXX XXXX Laptop computer from Amazon. Upon receipt of the Laptop on XX/XX/2020 and after attempting to install some custom software that I use, I found that the laptop would not run my custom software programs. Laptop was reset to factory settings and laptop was returned. During this time, during the XXXX season Amazon made an arrangement with XXXX Department stores that a person could take any item that needed to be returned to XXXX and XXXX would take responsibility for the repacking and reshipping of returned items back to Amazon at no cost to the consumer. I returned the Laptop to the return dept. at our local XXXX Department store and was given a returned receipt ( which I have included a copy ) to prove my return. I had used this same service for another item I ordered online from Amazon and returned with no problem. During this time, Amazon has also sent me a gift card of which I assumed I received because I was a member of their Prime program and had ordered quite a few items from them. I did not request the gift card, they just sent it to me. I also did sign up for their credit card which I did use to purchase the laptop. The total cost came to {$300.00} Upon the return of the XXXX XXXX, I later received a bill for {$190.00} from Syncrony Bank which issues the Amazon Credit Card I used for the purchase. I called Syncrony Bank and explained that I had returned the laptop and Amazon had accepted the return. They told me that I still owned them {$190.00} for the purchase of the laptop and I should call Amazon customer support to work this out. I called Amazon and was told that I needed to clear this up with Syncrony Bank. I explained that I had already spoken to them and they had told me to call Amazon Support. To make a long story shorter, I called both sides about six times and was given hard to understand double talk about why I still owned Syncrony Bank the said amount for a laptop that I returned in good order ( factory reset ) within two days but still owed on the laptop. I was told that Amazon placed part of the return cost of the laptop into my gift card but did not cancel the balance of the return amount. I questioned Amazon about this and how exactly their gift card program works but could not decipher what the person was saying to me. ( judging by their accent, I was not speaking with anyone in the United States ). So I let it go about contacting both Amazon and Syncrony Bank because of the consistent double talk explanations. My argument is that the entire purchase that was returned should have been cancelled and if they did put some of the costs ( why they would do that I have no idea ) into the gift card they gave me, they should have explained that to me instead of automatically doing what they did without explaining it to me and automatically doing it without my permission. And although I have a high credit score, I am refusing to pay that amount of money to Syncrony Bank for a laptop that I do not have in my possession. It would be just giving my money away. So unless theres some bizarre reason that Im liable for this situation, I have not sent them any payment even though they are harassing me for payment and threatening to cause a lowering of my credit scores. In order to protect my credit scores it appears I will be forced to make payment unless something can be done to rectify this situation. I would like to have your office look into this for me. Perhaps they will give you a clearer response and explanation than I am getting from them.

I was very excited to book a vacation for me and my family that was to occur between XX/XX/2022 XX/XX/2022, in XXXX, Florida. I paid half the balance on XX/XX/XXXX and the other half on XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX host company XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Everything was going as planned and arrangements were being made for the family trip. On XX/XX/2022 my son went into the hospital with pains in his stomach. He was admitted and the prognosis remained good. His XXXX and XXXX were having a hard time functioning but were still operating. I chose not to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX at that time because I was still hopeful my son would recover and would be able to join us in Florida. 

Around the XXXX of XXXX, my son took a turn for the worse. He was placed on XXXX and his XXXX XXXX  began deteriorating. On XX/XX/XXXX, even with my turmoil, I managed to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX to inform them we would not be able to make the trip and to advise me of my options. XXXX informed me of the strict cancellation policy however XXXX XXXX would change this policy if I would cancel and they were able to rebook. She also advised me over the phone that the chances of the property getting rebooked by someone else was very likely as it was high season. She also advised me I would only get a refund if the property rebooked. I decided that would be the only way to recoup my {$4000.00} so I followed the advice of the host company with their new terms. Needless to say, I never heard back from them. 

I decided to escalate my concern to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was subsequently advised there wasnt anything they could assist me with. At this point I was at the hospital with my son day and night and did not have the time nor energy to fight with the property management team. I contacted them several times and even cancelled my reservation upon their request. Had I not cancelled, they would not have rebooked the condo which they did. I even asked them if I could find someone to take over the booking but since I was the one on the reservation they couldn't work this out. I would have preferred to give it away rather than pay {$4000.00} for an empty condo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to initiate a dispute with Capital One. I was going to be out around {$4000.00} and was grappling with the idea of maybe needing the available credit to continue to stay at the hospital. When I detailed my situation to Capital One, I was told not to worry about anything and that I had enough on my plate already. The representative said everything would be taken care of. In fact, the transactions were reversed on my account but the available credit was never released. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my son XXXX XXXX from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I needed the available credit for funeral expenses rather than a beach vacation. As of today XX/XX/XXXX, my card is at its limit. I pleaded with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Capital One to provide me with some relief. I am disputing {$2000.00} and not a {$20.00} gas transaction. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX eventually rebooked the condo however I was only credited {$1400.00} and not the full {$4000.00}. This XXXX location essentially took my money, rebooked for the same week and collected on top of that. XXXX refused to assist and now Capital One is refusing. I escalated to a dispute manager, XXXX, and informed her 28 pages of documentation had been sent outlining every step of the process taken t o resolve this issue beginning with XXXX XXXX, then XXXX and finally Capital One. The argument Capital One is making is that I agreed to the cancellation policy when I booked even with the circumstances at hand I was still responsible for paying for a condo that got rebooked. I agree, but I also agreed to the new terms that were provided to me and documented in an email. Which one cancellation policy should I adhere to?? The first XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or the last proposal they gave me in early XXXX? Either way, I paid for a vacation I never took and was not even given the option to allow someone to take it for me. I would have gladly given it to a friend or close relative rather than letting it sit. The Capital One card is a Venture travel card ... Shouldn't their be some kind of insurance that comes with this for traveling?

Ive had the same set up since the loan inception I believe it was in XXXX. It gets sent out the same time of the month every month and theres never been an issue. I checked with my bank and all checks have been cashed that were sent to the mortgage company. My mortgage company states they did not receive XXXX XXXX mortgage payment. I also looked and saw one that several of my payments have been marked as late in XXXX which I know that is not true. The bank has a local branch here in XXXX XXXX so I want to try and fix it at the branch. When I got there I was met at the door by a gentleman that said that they are closed to customers because of Covid everyone has been working at home. The gentleman then proceeded to tell me that dozens of people come by there every day with the same complaint they say they have paid their mortgage as they always have and theyre not being credited or marked as delinquent. The gentleman states that because everyone is working at home things arent being properly credited and theyre not being credited on time. I have since gone to the mortgage website directly and an automatic payments through the mortgage paint company that way they cant say that Im not paying on time. I have lost 100 points on my credit score because they falsely reported that I did not pay my loan. I have since gone onto their website and paid everything that they said I owed in one lump sum and actually paid ahead so that they cant pull this with me anymore. The fact still remains that they cash the check of mine and did not give me credit for it.

54247,2021-07-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"In late XX/XX/2021, my wife and I started the process of looking for a mortgage to purchase our first home. We settled on Bank of America ( BOA ), despite our lawyer advising against it due to some bad prior experiences. However, BOA provided the lowest rate and closing cost estimate. 

Long story short, our initial mortgage officer ( NMLS # XXXX ) made various mistakes such as quoting me a different interest rate then what was actually provided. The individual was also not aware of what the processing department ( i.e., underwriters ) was doing because I had to inform the officer when the appraisal will happen and when it was done ( information my realtor provided ). Moreover, when an error occurred, the officer kept quiet and avoided responding to my emails, messages, voicemails. After all the incompetence, the officer 's manager ( NMLS # XXXX ) had to step in and take over our file. 

The situation only got worse because the manager told me I had to fire my attorney. After a couple of hours of confusion and panic, the manager told me to ignore the request. Apparently, someone at BOA thought my attorney was the bank 's attorney and did not see the name on an approved list. I also learned that it is typical of BOA to leave things to the last minute mainly because the processing department controls the show. The individual processing our file did not get to it until very last minute. My attorney and the bank 's attorney did not get the final documents until after XXXX the day before the close. There is more to the story, but I will end my complaint here.

246799,2021-01-27,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"To Whom it May Concern, I applied for a lease in XX/XX/XXXX with an apartment complex ; The Academy on XXXX, and signed it in XX/XX/XXXX before knowing that my university would cancel in-person classes nearly six months later. I never paid a security deposit, never paid first and last rent, never paid a single dime to the landlord ; all I did was sign the document. Exactly 30 days before the lease would start on XX/XX/XXXX, I told the landlord over their messaging portal that I want to exit my lease ( despite there being no exit option ). He told me no, and I said I wasn't going to pay it. I got no response back after that. Two months later at the end of XXXX, he sent me an eviction notice and charged me the full 12 months of rent ( which is illegal under Maryland 's rental code ), selling the debt to BYL Collections. I got their written notice a month later around XX/XX/XXXX, responded by certified mail that I was disputing the debt, asked them to verify it, and verified that they received it. This month when I got my monthly credit report, my score had dropped over 100 points due to their inaccurate debt collection. 

XXXX XXXX on XXXX and now the illegal collection attempt by BYL Collections are taking part in an illegal move to circumvent Covid19 restrictions handed down by the very university which acts in accordance to federal oversight and mandate for social distancing in response to the pandemic. 
Furthermore, I had acted in good faith before the pandemic and can not be held accountable for the pandemic itself or the aftermath of such a devastating ordeal. While I do not argue that I filed out the application I never paid a cent, never took possession of the property and was never evicted by anyone for any reason. Everything that has transpired has done so on paper by a company intent on bilking me of monies certainly not owed and holding over my head the ruination of my consumer credit files. 

Furthermore i am including in my documentation the code of Maryland which it is my belief and position that the landlord and by extension BYL Collections is violating, this over and above all the restrictions and federal guidelines in the application of Covid19 safety guidelines and Covid19 consumer abuse. 

I am asking that this agency intercede on my behalf, review the information and documents and contact the companies mentioned in my complaint, assuring that this issue which they have clearly not taken seriously, is rectified under the supervision of this agency. I am available to speak further on the matter and to provide any other information not provided in this complaint if any.",,BYL Collection Services,FL,32837,,Consent provided,Web,2021-01-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4099140

169493,2021-10-18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"This past weekend my bank went through conversion as PNC was taking over. As a previous employee the bank, I had expectations about how this was going to be handled. To say it fell very short of expectations is an understatement. Ill leave all the issues with getting funds to others because Im sure there are a lot of those. I have personally prided myself on my credit. My scores hover around 800. I have never had a transaction denied. I had worked at BBVA also and even though I worked at other banks I always used my bbva credit card due to rewards earned. I used it religiously and did not use a debit card. Well I was leaving for a trip without my family Thursday until today. So on Wednesday evening of XX/XX/XXXX I went to pay for my luggage through XXXX  XXXX  and it would not go through. I called XXXX  and after 10 minutes I was told it was declined. So first off I was not happy since I have never been more embarrassed but more importantly I had no idea why. Back up a few weeks. I looked at PNCs website with their welcome and what to expect during conversion specifically credits cards. After 29 minutes of searching. It said that I would be able to use my credit card through conversion and after conversion I would receive a new PNC card to start using upon arrival. Well I called PNC and after 25-30 minutes Im told that PNC had just created my new card and I should receive it in a few days and by the way, your old card wont work. Here I am leaving my wife and kids at home with a credit card to use, Im going away with a credit card to use and guess what, I have no access to my credit. How is this possible to post information on your website and not follow through? I still have no credit and I feel very lucky that nothing happened where I was in dire need. Im not sure what the laws state specific to credit since they had XXXX reason for me not to have access except for this cluster of a conversion. The lady I spoke to couldnt turn it back on and and told me basically I was stuck and nothing they could do. Ive never been so embarrassed and still aggravated I dont have a card. 

In addition I was not properly disclosed to about the changes. In XXXX I moved to XXXX area. I had changed my address with BBVA in XXXX. Well apparently that change did not get to PNC. A week before conversion I had to call and verify a bbva had the correct address, PNC kept sending to my old address. Also I explore someone to actually go to PNCs website and find credit card conversion. Its like the hidden ball trick. 

If I want to send an email or call someone above a basic customer service person, there is no way to route that. They dont provide that information to the public. I have attempted calling, emailing using XXXX. I complained on XXXX directly to PNC customer service and didnt get a response for 3 days Ive worked at a lot of XXXX  and have been through many conversions and this one by far was the most disorganized one with the worst communication.

1467392,2021-06-29,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"This VA backed mortgage account was under forbearance when I requested to apply for refinancing on XX/XX/XXXX. Instead, I received notice that I have until XX/XX/XXXX to come up with a lump sum payment of everything under forbearance, {$9800.00} plus any additional fees, payments and late charges that come due before that date, under threat of foreclosure proceedings on that date. 

Upon my first application for forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX, I was led to believe that the payments under forbearance would be nearly automatically placed at the back end of my mortgage, with little action on my part. Without this assurance, I never would have signed on to a forbearance agreement. 

I reached out to SunTrust now Truist on XX/XX/XXXX, as we are prompted to do in every correspondence and article, with my request for a refinance. Instead of responding to my direct request for refinance, SunTrust now Truist started the foreclosure clock ticking. They have yet to respond to ANY of my questions or requests, simply provided canned denial letters, never even acknowledging my request to refinance. 

Incidentally, although I have been reading that forbearance up to 18 months is possible, I had been allowed under 12 months protection when this demand letter came Dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

SunTrust now Truist has ignored the protections for VA mortgages under the VA mortgage loan program, the Cares Act and the American Rescue plan act in that they have refused to address my request for refinance, they are requiring me to make a lump sum payment of forbearance balance under threat of foreclosure and, although the foreclosure moratorium was extended to the end of XXXX, I am still under threat of foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I believe I will be eligible to receive help under the American Rescue Plan Act {$10.00} XXXX dollar fund if and when Kentucky ever gets their process in place to distribute these funds. I am registered to receive notification when that happens. 

I have approximately 50 % equity in this property - my ONLY asset after the death of my veteran husband. 

My income is set to increase by approximately $ XXXX/mo in XX/XX/XXXX, on my XXXX birthday when I become eligible to collect Social Security survivors benefit. 

I have provided my plan for a cash out refinance sufficient to pay off my {$12000.00} auto loan and maintain the new mortgage payment for the 6 months until XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX benefits begin. I have worked in banking. I have made mortgages. I know this plan is perfectly doable. 

SunTrust now Truist has yet to respond to ANY of my requests to refinance OR questions about their non adherence to VA mortgage rules set out by Congress. 

I have never spoken to or received any correspondence from a loan officer. There is absolutely NO direct communication allowed for. You speak only to data processors by phone, who know nothing about the actual account. I stopped answering the telephone calls when the callers didn't even know the account was under forbearance or that I have written repeatedly. Instead, I have requested all correspondence to be in writing. Still, no acknowledgement of my request to refinance. 

I cared for my XXXX Veteran husband during his final years spent fighting XXXX XXXX attributed to his time in country exposed to XXXX XXXX. A terrible, violently painful way to die ... in service to his country. 

I ALONE cared for his every need along with all other duties and tasks while he was sick. I too, in that way, have served my country. 

I believe SunTrust now Truist should be held accountable to the promises Congress expressed through the Cares Act and the American Rescue Plan Act as well as the promises afforded by the VA mortgage loan program. 

There are millions of folks in my same situation all over the country. Banks should not be allowed AGAIN to run rough shod over the laws and regulations as they have in the past and most certainly NOT for VA mortgage loan borrowers.

822379,2021-10-02,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"On XX/XX/2021, Midland Credit Management served me with a notice to appear to a pre-trial conference/mediation, alleging I owed them {$3300.00} on a credit card debt originally issued by XXXX XXXX , which they had purchased. This was the first time I heard of that alleged debt. I called their lawyer up and ask for details. The lawyer asked if I knew of an address in Kentucky, which was totally unknown to me. Upon a quick investigation with the vendor, it appeared I was victim of identity theft. I filed a report, appeared at the pre-trial conference, and submitted a Counterclaim in the Small Claims Court. The derogatory report submitted by Midland to the various CRAs resulted in StudentAid declining me a {$30000.00} Parent Plus Student Loan for my son who is in Senior year in College, and for his landlord declining me as a guarantor for his lease. My son was in mental health therapy at the time and this additional stress clearly aggravated his condition. I asked for {$8000.00} on damages.

A couple of days after the conference, Midland asked the Court to dismiss their claim, and filed a Motion to Dismiss my Counterclaim, arguing that "" Courts have consistently concluded that the FCRA does not provide a private cause of action for violations of Section 1681s-2 ( a ). See 15 U.S.C. 1682s-2 ( d ) : Longman, 702 F.3d at 151 ( "" [ T ] he statute plainly restricts enforcement of [ 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) to federal and state authorities. "" ), '' and concluding "" Even assuming all of the allegations were true and taken in the light most favorable to the Defendant, the Counterclaim would still fail to state any claim upon which relief may be granted under the FCRA. '' I was served with the Motion to Dismiss on XX/XX/2021. 

I have not heard from the Court yet, and I would like to know if indeed Midland 's assertion that I have no cause of action is correct. If it is, please let me know how best handle this matter in order to obtain proper redress.

948999,2022-10-03,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2019, a fraudulent mortgage was entered into the public record of XXXX XXXX Recorder of Deeds, located on XXXX N. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, SC XXXX ; Book XXXX and Page XXXX. The mortgage was created by XXXX XXXX and on the public record there is a person named XXXX XXXX, both of Fairway Independent Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX. 

The reason for this complaint is that the mortgage clearly states that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a MARRIED MAN. This is clear deception on the record and I feel this is in violation of the truth in lending and Fair Debt Collection Practice Act. 15 U.S.C. 1692 ( j ) says that you can't furnish deceptive forms. 

Because of this action brought on by the Brokers in this Financial Institution, It has caused me a great deal of trouble in finding out the truth to how another company has come to acquire my name, my social security number, my address, without consent given from the consumer. 

15 U.S.C. 1692 ( b ), as to where another company has acquired my location information, claiming that I owe a debt. This is false and misleading unfair business practices who initiated the course of this ordeal that I have had to endure. 

I was approved for financing from the beginning. According to the truth in lending, financing pay for every thing directly or indirectly. So how is it that the brokers took it upon themselves to write up a mortgage contract to deceive me into thinking that I owe a debt when no existed from the beginning? 

I have been harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a payment of a debt on a mortgage that has been created under false pretense. For one, I am not a married man. I have no marriage license by any law. The debt was paid by the financing but yet I am being told that I owe a debt from another company. 

I believe my location information was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I say that because I disputed the debt on my public score and the credit bureau 's found it necessary to remove XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because there was no wet ink signature to the contract. 

The Credit Bureau will not just remove a "" creditor '' if there is a valid debt that can be proven by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Fairway Independent Mortgage of XXXX, SC have trashed my name through the courts along with XXXX XXXX, SERVICING. They have tried to foreclose on me time after time. 

This is identity theft, fraud, unfair business practices, harassment, abuse, and I demand that these criminals be brought to justice for their actions against a consumer. 

The original note and mortgage have already been sold in pool of mortgages and notes on the stock market. This is what they do, and sell/assign a copy of the mortgage and note to another company who demands payment, and claim they have interest in a property through fraudulent contracts made in the name of the consumer without full disclosure. 

Under 15 U.S.C. 1611, there is a criminal liability associated with these actions. I expect the CFPB and other federal agency 's to enforce that rule because this behavior is criminal. 

All applications are letters of credit and letters of credit are authenticated by signature. If I am required to pay a debt then that would mean I was not financed. This is a total violation of the truth in lending, FDCPA, the XXXX, and numerous federal laws.

Please produce the original promissory note/ security instrument to see whose signature is there for endorsement.

I have reviewed my credit report and noticed several inaccurate and unfair items, including late payment accounts and charge off accounts. 
Firstly, regarding the late payment accounts for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX ), and XXXXXXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX ), I would like to point out that these accounts were a result of temporary financial difficulties. While I admit that I fell behind on payments, I have since caught up and am now current on all accounts. I kindly request that you remove these late payment accounts from my credit report, as I believe they are unfairly affecting my credit score. 
Secondly, I noticed that XXXX XXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX ) has charged off my account. I am devastated by this news, as I have always strived to maintain a good credit history. However, I was not made aware of this charge off until I reviewed my credit report. I kindly request that you provide me with more information about this charge off, as I believe it may be inaccurate or unfair. If the charge off is indeed valid, I would appreciate the opportunity to work out a payment plan to satisfy this debt and prevent further damage to my credit report. 
Finally, I am disputing the charge off accounts associated with XXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX ) and XXXX ( account number : XXXX ). I have no recollection of opening these accounts, and I have not received any communication from your company regarding them. I kindly request that you provide me with more information about these accounts and take appropriate steps to remove them from my credit report if they are found to be inaccurate or fraudulent. 
As a law-abiding citizen, I understand the importance of maintaining good credit. However, the negative items on my credit report are causing me great emotional distress and anxiety. I kindly request that you investigate these matters thoroughly and respond promptly, as I am eager to resolve these issues and restore my good credit history. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Under the subsection 15 usc 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) the reporting agency does not have my written instructions to report anything.

The credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, Experian, and XXXX ) do not have my written permission and this should be removed accordingly. 

I am under the impression that it seems as if a company has taken advantage of obtaining my personal address for their benefit. There is a huge risk of having the incorrect address on my consumer report because this could potentially be identity theft. 

I know that under the following law the CRA has to delete inaccurate information. 1681i.

Ultimately these issues, coupled with the fact that the route I agreed to was no longer available, I decided to seperated from the company. 

On XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, attended an oreintation for XXXX XXXX. This oreintaton was supppose to include meal and lodging, as well as classroom training for the duration of the training. However, we I got to the hotel, which was the meet-up spot listed in the oreintation letter, I found that the lodging conditions where unhealthy and fit to stay ( red flag XXXX ). Ultimately, I ended u booking a room at the XXXX XXXX and staying there until Wednesday the XXXX. 

Upon arriving at the terminal, we were ushered in the conference room, where were instructed to complete multple training exercises via our handheld devices ; this went on the entire monday and tuesday. In additon, we did a XXXX drug test and continued to work on those videos for the remainder of our orentation days we work on the training videos. Furthermore, during the orentation I informed the presenter that I do not eat meat and was informed that they would provide accommodations. To my surprise, my dietary request went unmet ( red flag XXXX ). In closing, we were in structed that we would be put with a trainer to go Over The Road ( OTR ) for training on Wednesday the XXXX. Again to my surprise, I did not go out with a trainer until Monday the XXXX, which lasted until Thursday the XXXX ( red flag XXXX ). 

During my time over the road, I had several disputes with the Driver Manager ( DM ) over issues related to compensation and home time. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX out with a trainer and was not allowed the opportuntiy to driver. On XX/XX/XXXX, I informed the DM of this, he told me I would not get paid for that day ( red flag XXXX ). After several conversations with supervisors I was paid for that day. Prior to leaving for OTR training I informed the DM that I had an court obligation to pick my son up from daycare on friday mornings and return him on monday mornings. Initatially the DM reassured me this would not be a problem ; however I soon learn that was false. On XX/XX/XXXX, I inquired about me returning home and was met with a response stating I would have to stay out OTR 6 more day. This did not fit my obligation and would have put me in direct violation of the court order. After several conversations ith the DM, that ultimately went no where, I decided XXXX XXXX was not a fit for me, so I book a flight back to MD. 

Over the next few hours, the DM and several other tried to convince me to stay and even threaten to sue me multiple times for me fullfiling my contract. It was also during this time that I learned that the route I was offered and choose was no longer available. The DM tried to force me into accepting a new route ; however I continued to refuse. Again I was met with multiple threats ( Red Flag 6 ).

Once I returned home, I contacted HR for a copy of my contract and personnel file ; I recieved the contract but was denied access to the file. Over next few days, I was contacted by different people who were requesting me to come back to work.

Meaning that if you do not have or have not gotten any written instructions from me ( THE CONSUMER ) to furnish an account on my report. It should not be there. That is a violation. I never gave written instructions to furnish any of the following accounts.

Secondly according to the 15 USC 1681.The law clearly states.

1. Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. The Congress makes the following findings : 2. The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

The issue as reported by the CFPB agent was not accurate. My issue was never that my credit reports were not updated since 2018 regarding this account. 

My issue is that the account is not being correctly reported by the creditor. This account was not included in or discharged in my bankruptcy. This account was paid in full, in good standing 2 months prior to my bankruptcy discharge, which they were not listed as a creditor in. They chose to close the account on their own authority due to the fact they were made aware of my bankruptcy and not because they were included in it. No debt was owed to this company at the time of my bankruptcy, nor was any debt discharged in my bankruptcy. 

Now my credit report is worse off than it was previously was, as it previously reported "" Discharged through Bankruptcy XXXX  XXXXNever Late '' to now just reporting "" Discharged through Bankruptcy XXXX  XXXX '' so my credit looks worse than it did previously. 

Reporting debt as being discharged in bankruptcy when it was not discharged in bankruptcy has to be violating some type of Fair Credit Reporting law and I will file a complaint with every legal entity I can until I get this resolved.

This account has been reported by Equifax for over a year, despite my repeated requests to have it removed. The account in question is from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, with the account number # XXXX, Stated amount {$1000.00}. 

I have already submitted a FTC Identity Theft Report, which clearly documents that this account is fraudulent and should be deleted from my consumer report. However, Equifax has refused to take any action and has continued to report this account, which has damaged my credit score and made it difficult for me to obtain credit or loans. 

Equifax 's failure to delete this fraudulent account is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Despite having knowledge of the fraudulent nature of this account, Equifax has not done any due diligence to investigate the information they have reported, which is a further violation of the FCRA. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take immediate action to hold Equifax accountable for their actions and ensure that they comply with the FCRA. I am also requesting that Equifax take immediate steps to remove the fraudulent account from my consumer report and provide me with a corrected copy of my report. 

In addition, I request that Equifax block any further attempts by the fraudulent party to create or use accounts in my name. This is necessary to protect my identity and prevent any further damage to my credit score. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am writing to address a concerning matter regarding an unauthorized hard inquiry on my credit report, which I believe to be fraudulent and in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I kindly request that XXXX XXXX promptly investigate and remove this inquiry from my credit report. 

Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered an unauthorized hard inquiry dated XX/XX/2023. I would like to emphasize that I did not authorize this inquiry nor did I have any prior knowledge of it. This unauthorized inquiry not only impacts my credit score but also raises concerns about potential fraudulent activity. 

Under the FCRA, consumers have the right to dispute any inaccurate or unauthorized information on their credit reports. According to Section 1681b of the FCRA, entities seeking access to an individual 's credit report must obtain the consumer 's written consent before pulling their credit records. As I did not provide authorization for this inquiry, I believe it is in violation of this provision. 

I kindly request that XXXX XXXX promptly investigate this matter and take appropriate action to remove the unauthorized hard inquiry from my credit report. I also request that you provide me with a written confirmation once the inquiry has been removed. 

Enclosed with this letter, please find a screenshot of my credit report highlighting the unauthorized hard inquiry for your reference. I trust that you will handle this matter promptly and in accordance with the law. If necessary, I am prepared to take further action to protect my rights under the FCRA. 

I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the steps being taken to resolve this issue. Thank you for your cooperation.

I received a statement in XXXX this year showing a transaction of XXXX dollars charged to my credit card from XXXX, XXXX. 
Transaction date was XX/XX/XXXX and posting date XX/XX/XXXX. 
I visited XXXX in XXXX and I have not been out of country or in XXXX since then. 
I did not lose my credit card and it has been with me. 
I called the Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and talked for a long time and told the detail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter saying that the card was used and chip was read that time and so it was a valid claim. 
I called the Bank at the # provided and they called back my cell #. 
I talked to the specialist and the supervisor as they allowed me to talk to for over XXXX minutes. I tried to talk to someone higher up in the authority who can help to further investigate this fraudulent claim but was not able to. 
I asked whether there was any transaction in that card in XXXX in XXXX but they refused to give me that information. 
I have not been to XXXX or anywhere else outside XXXX in XXXX or XXXX and the card was with me. So it was impossible to use my card in XXXX in XXXX XXXX. 
They could not explain how the chip was read or the card used when I had not been there and the card was with me and no duplicate copy of the card. 
They did not give me any convincing reason how it could be possible. 
They did not give any answer how they investigated the fraud claim and whether any federal or law enforcing agency was involved as this seems to me a certain fraud case. 
They could not explain why they approve a very unusual foreign transaction without verification and without contacting or verifying with the card holder. 
I always notify the credit card company if I am going out of State or out of Country, and they did not receive any such notifications / alert from me.

Given the unusual nature of this transaction I asked whether anyone in the company could be associated with this kind of fraudulent activity, which they did not answer and did not say whether any law enforcing agency involved in that regard. 
They said they would open another investigation to look into the matter. 
I received another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they found it was a valid transaction and the fraud claim was closed. 
Now given that I could not be there in XXXX to use my credit card and it was always with me, yet the company / Bank of America maintained that it was a valid transaction - it raised a serious question whether the credit card company be involved in this fraudulent activity and whether they or others involved in activities defrauding their credit card holders. 
I called the Bank of America again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked for my options and provide me with the names of the State and federal regulatory agencies or other Law enforcing Agencies where I can take this case for further review but I was told to XXXX it and they could not provide me any.

Please keep the Requirements set forth by the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) laying out consumers ' rights to dispute credit card issuers ' charges. 

Charges must be over {$50.00} to be eligible for dispute. 
They may be unauthorized, display an incorrect date or amount, or contain calculation errors. 
If a good or service was not delivered, that charge can be disputed. 

The card issuer has 30 days to acknowledge receipt of a complaint. They then have two billing cycles to complete their investigation ; during that time the issuer is not allowed to try to collect the payment, charge interest on it, or report it to credit bureaus as late. 

If the card issuer finds that the disputed payment was invalid, it must correct the error and refund any fees or interest charged as a result. If it finds there was no error, it must explain its findings and, upon request, provide documentation to back them up. 

I have not received any notice of any investigation has occurred, or the results of such investigation. If Navy did conduct an investigation, I once again request documentation to back up the findings. Please keep in mind the card issuer has 30 days to acknowledge receipt of a complaint. They then have two billing cycles to complete their investigation ; during that time the issuer is not allowed to try to collect the payment, charge interest on it, or report it to credit bureaus as late. To date, Navy has tried to collect payment for the amount in dispute and charged interest on it, violation FCBA statutes. 

Your reply as shown below failed to address my response to your request for documentation. Nowhere in the FCBA is there a provision requiring the consumer to provide the documentation requested. If such documentation existed there would be no dispute between myself and the merchant, which is my right to have investigated and charged back. 

My original reply provided the pertinent FCBA, XXXX, or XXXX dispute resolution guide requirements, and consumer rights. However, this seems to have been ignored yet again, as you are still asking for things that are not required, and had I such documentation there would not be a dispute between myself and the merchant. However, as there is a dispute I have invoked my rights under applicable laws when I submitted my original dispute, which is attached below. 

The key points are I invoke my rights under UCC 4214, issued 2002 to chargeback and refund this transaction. 
o Currently, these rights under this and other statutes are being violated by Navy. 
I requested a temporary credit if the dispute in question takes significant time to investigate. 
The dispute was according made per XXXX XXXX Reason Code 4831 or 4834 under the newest XXXX dispute resolution guide. 
o It indicates that the transaction amount wasn't what I, the cardholder agreed to. 
o These chargebacks are usually caused by a merchant failing to notify a customer of a change in the transaction amount. 
o When the conditions of a purchase change and the price is affected, merchants may sometimes make adjustments without first notifying the customer or seeking a new authorization approval. 
o When the cardholder is unaware of these adjustments and did not agree to pay the new amount, they have grounds to dispute the transaction. 
o In some circumstances, cardholders may be asked to approve a variable amount to be charged later. If the transaction exceeds the maximum amount they agreed to pay, they can dispute this charge on the basis that the overcharge was unreasonable.

I spoke to 1 person on the phone from XXXX and he was very disrespectful. I kept explaining to him there's fraud on my account and he kept asking me the same questions over and over and not comprehending what I was saying. He also told me to send in my report which I did and still no change or anything. This Is very alarming what's going on, because this means criminals can just go around and steal innocent peoples information and identity and nothing is being done about it. I will have to get a lawyer and sue all 3 companies if this is not resolved immediately. This is also making me believe some of these companies can be involved with he fraud and now don't want to make it right. I would like my report to be taken seriously and have them remove these fraudulent accounts off my credit report. Please update me with a solution to this problem because next I have to contact the XXXX and Attorney General to look into this matter and seek compensation, cause this is not right on so much levels.

This is clearly an indication of the racket they know and have as it relates to their false advertising and bait & switch tactics. 

American Express has systemic bait & switch systems in place that advertise benefits and then refuses to provide their customers. 

Their software is not aligned with their advertisements. It refuses to give American Express consumers & small business benefits promised. 

Management knows this and continues to attempt to steal from their own customers by saving on costs by rejecting legitimate claims all the while continuing to deceive ( falsely advertise ) and encouraging them to sign up for their expensive cards.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. I have lost faith in the banking systems due to your company reporting false and inaccurate information on my report without my consent.

I inquired on how to pay and was told I had to file a dispute since there was no Name of the company or # or address on the account. After requesting the dispute form twice. I finally received the form and completed it. I then sent it back to Equifax via email and fax on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received an email notification stating it was received. But the fax was completed. After the 30day mark, I did call and ask numerous agents that I was able to get a hold of to confirm when my dispute was received, to be told that the investigation is not yet completed. One agent, in particular, told me to send ANOTHER dispute form since he didn't see my dispute form in the system! He was very rude and condescending. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me I could not. I hung up and finally reached an agent by the name of XXXX and he apologized for the last agent as he was incorrect in asking me to send another dispute form. He gave me a case # and tracking # and told me that my file was going to be escalated and that within 48hrs I would be getting a call from the XXXX office to help me in finding out where my dispute was. I then received a call on the 2nd day after it was escalated but couldn't answer the call.

I did not receive any statements ( online or via mail ) starting after XX/XX/XXXX for my account. Every time I logged in to my account online, it said {$0.00} was due and that no interest was accruing. I thought that this was because of the federal student loan pause. In the middle of the month in XX/XX/XXXX, my account all of a sudden showed past due and interest had accrued ( my balance went up due to interest and late fees ). I did not receive a statement for this. I called the company in XXXX to ask what happened that they told me it was an internal error that erroneously marked my account as matured, and therefore it stopped sending me statements since XX/XX/XXXX. It was flagged in XX/XX/XXXX and then the account payments resumed, without them notifying me. I had just happened to log in to my online account for a second time that month to find out about the balance going up and past due payments. When I called the company in XX/XX/XXXX, they assured me this would not be reported to the credit bureaus and that I would need to file a forbearance form. I told them I didnt want future forbearance, but to have the past due amount and related interest removed from my account. I filled out the form anyway stating all of this info, and the they changed my account information online to show I was current and had late fees removed ( but interest from this time period was never removed ). In XXXX, I received notice from my credit monitoring service that my credit scores from all three credit bureaus had gone down by an average of 40 points due to a missed payment on this student loan account that had been reported. I called the loan servicer to ask for this to be removed since it wasnt my fault, and they said it would be removed at the end of the month ( XXXX ) since the account now says current. I also filed a dispute with all 3 credit bureaus stating what happened. The dispute did not change the past due payment listed on the account. As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), my credit reports all still reflect the erroneously reported past due payment. I called the loan servicer today and they showed on their end they had reported to the credit bureaus that there are no past due payments and there was nothing else they could do.

Call Summary : XXXX XXXX promised to call me back after speaking with PNC Fraud Department about my XX/XX/XXXX I filed PNC Fraud claims at night in the evening. 
During this conversation after politely introducing myself and explaining what happened, I simply asked her : ( 1. ) What is the current status of my PNC Fraud Claims? 
( 2. ) What are my options as far as having my claims actually investigated? 
( 3. ) Why werent my PNC Bank Fraud Claims initially investigated? 
( 4. ) I explained to XXXX XXXX the gust of my claims regarding both the XXXX Bus Ticket fraud claim from Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and that also, the fraud claims for all of the unaccounted for online PNC Bank fraudulent debit card transactions are definitely the exact result of my old friend and now long-time stalker XXXX XXXX XXXX , who it appears defrauded me mostly throughout the month of XX/XX/XXXX on or near my birthday because unfortunately shes the only close friend that Ive had over the years who has realized that Ive definitely had a birthday in the month of XX/XX/XXXX, due to the fact that Ive had to give her workplace College Admissions Office and Continuing Education Office all of this information ever since Fall XXXX semester on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the Public Information Officer and my former Disability Support Services Counselor at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX I waited very patiently every day up until the end of the current business week on the last business day of Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, but I never received a follow-up call e-mail, unfortunately. I also havent received the XX/XX/XXXX PNC Bank bank statements that XXXX promised me and assured me that she would send me in the postal mail. 
XXXX XXXX was quick to basically shoot down my request so fast in terms of how quickly she denied my request that she simply denied my request so altogether when I requested that she e-mail me my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement. Furthermore, when I also expressed to her that having her send me my XX/XX/XXXX PNC Bank statement via e-mail was the faster and virtually more convenient method of sending me my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement, she was even quicker and more confidently with impressionable back-bone reiterated to me that that she definitely couldnt extend me the courtesy of giving me the PNC Bank XX/XX/XXXX bank statement. XXXX XXXX with a condescending tone of voice, continued to rudely talk over me for the remainder of the duration of the phone call with her both cold and highly dismissive attitude for no apparent reason, inspire of the fact that I was very polite and highly, no wait far too considerate in my tone of voice when speaking to her over the phone. 
I dont appreciate this type of treatment at all from PNC Bank XXXX 
Furthermore, I dont agree that XXXX as she claims in her e-mail addressed to me at date : XXXX ( ESDT ), Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Also, in the e-mail XXXX XXXX negligently and dishonestly lied about calling me before in the Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any phone calls at all from XXXX XXXX before. 
Furthermore, I was heartbroken at the fact that XXXX XXXX didnt follow-up with me afterwards, like she deceptively promised me she would, to make matters worse, I definitely, naively anticipated that she would follow-up with me for nothing because I negligently didnt receive a single phone call or e-mail from XXXX XXXX. Overall, unfortunately, there was no further XXXX XXXX all afterwards since last Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
This very strange, cold and its definitely very negligent, the irresponsible inability of XXXX XXXX, PNC Executive Client Services to follow-up with me afterwards. 
I dont feel like PNC took our business client relationship seriously at all and thats ridiculously horrendous, especially, considering the fact that I was a customer with PNC Bank for about 2 years ever since about XX/XX/XXXX. This is definitely terrible because its typically standard procedure for most banks to value long term customers and I was a PNC Bank client for about 2 whole years. 

This is far too much negligence, in my opinion because its literally 7 months later and PNC Bank is still not giving me a sufficiently satisfactory answer to adequately explain to me the original source of all of these fraudulent online debit card transactions, which occurred on my PNC Bank account during the month of XX/XX/XXXX.",,PNC Bank N.A.,WA,98226,,Consent provided,Web,2021-10-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4800346

1601763,2021-07-13,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Preparing ahead of a purchase, I began addressing errors on my credit reports with Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  in XX/XX/2021. I disputed items with each Bureau, but to date they have only made the necessary corrections to some of my personal information, despite any evidence I have provided regarding the listed accounts with errors. For example, in their correspondence, the companies list XXXX XXXX XXXX as the provider of public information contained in my consumer report. 

I secured my consumer report from XXXX in XX/XX/2021 and they responded with the attached letter in XX/XX/2021 stating that they corrected some personal identifying data and deleted the bankruptcy record in question, XXXX. On XX/XX/2021 I wrote to Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  with a copy of my MD Real ID and the results from XXXX asking them to correct my respective reports. Today I received the results of my Experian dispute alleging they verified the data with the provider. This is clearly false, as the attached letter confirms. 

I have filed similar disputes with XXXX  and XXXX  and have been in the same fight since XX/XX/2021. I fully expect the same runaround behavior, as they have all previously "" verified '' disputed accounts with XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. In the interest of being thorough, I contacted each credit reporting agency and the companies in question. All state that the information is correct as of XX/XX/2021. However, not all the data is consistent across the board. I purchased the XXXX XXXX service to compare the three reports together. Origination date, closing date, amount owed, status as of XX/XX/2021 and all other categories should reflect the exact same information, as it was allegedly verified at the source. It clearly does not match. If any investigation was actually performed each time, as required by FCRA, there would be no inconsistency. 

Regarding XXXX, I filed a complaint here about an account with XXXX. It was allegedly investigated and "" verified '' by XXXX  with the provider. I contacted the provider and was referred back to XXXX. I used the process. It failed me. But I persisted and XXXX eventually corrected the error ( documentation attached ) in XX/XX/2021, after reporting erroneously for four ( 4 ) solid years. 

This dishonesty and disregard is a pattern that must be corrected. As a consumer, I have the legal right to confront providers about errors and have them removed, timely. Across the board, I submit a dispute, they update my legal name and current address, while housing numerous other addresses, co-applicants, and refusing to contact providers of data to correct misinformation. This is completely illegal, not to mention costly because new accounts will judge me by this nonsense. 

The last time I filed a complaint here about Experian 's dispute resolution practices ( within the last 2 months ), they pretended they couldn't verify my identity and the complaint died. Transunion stood firm on their position that the data was correct. In actuality, they're blatantly disregarding facts, perpetuating fraud by reporting misinformation. Per FCRA, consumer reporting agencies have a DUTY to report accurate information, timely. This includes personal information, addresses, accounts and balances. The consumer literally pays when they fail to do so. 

I am asking you to enforce my consumer rights and make these private, for-profit companies do right by me promptly.

They claimed the loan I had with them required the insurance but I didnt have it. I had active homeowners insurance but they didnt care they still created more and more fraudulent accounts and charged my checking account. I requested a refund but they refused. They offered me {$50.00}, {$100.00}, and {$1000.00} on a {$15000.00} claim to close my complaint. I refused their minimum offers because they destroyed my credit and gave me eight years of grief so far on this issue. They even assigned a negotiator but only offered me {$1000.00} which I refused while requesting {$15000.00}. 
I am requesting your assistance to resolve this dispute. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Alaska XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Well Fargo claim XXXX, filed in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX Dear WFClaims, I am so tried of attempting to contact you regarding your financial abuse of our banking systems and the Federal Governments direction to you to resolve your illegal Wells Fargo account activations. I first noticed you illegally account creations for me back in XXXX. 
You created thousands of dollars worth of charges on my Wells Fargo account because you incorrectly charged my account because you thought I didnt have home owners insurance on my home used as security in my Wells Fargo mortgage. Thousands of dollars of fees were generated because you magically created homeowners insurance accounts for me without my knowledge. When your illegal actions were discovered the litigations began. You started off offering me {$50.00} to forget the issue, then {$1000.00}. 
See the below emails. I rejected them all because you have caused me tens of thousands of dollars of pain over theses issues. Then you just decided to ignore me. 

I filed a claim with Wells Fargo regarding how they stole thousands of dollars from me by creating duplicate homeowners insurance policies for me and paying for them by stealing the payments from my Wells Fargo checking account. Wells Fargo claim # XXXX, filed in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX new account. # XX/XX/XXXX. 


My claim originates from Wells Fargo creating non-authorized homeowners insurance accounts in my name for the line of credit I have with them. They required that I have homeowners insurance and after I got it and informed them of it they then created non-authorized parallel homeowners insurance accounts for me on two separate occasions.

Just one event resulted in a duplicate {$400.00} per month homeowners policy for approximately 11 months. The other cost me {$600.00} per month for another duplicate homeowners policy for approximately 11 months. These outrageous premiums were generated by Wells Fargo granting access to my credit report to these insurance companies. The FCRA requires any user of a credit report to notify the consumer and Wells Fargo never notified me of these actions. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 


Well Fargo automatically without my permission paid for these duplicate policies by stealing the outrageous month payments from my Well Fargo checking account! I knew nothing of these Wells Fargo illegal actions. Wells Fargo failed to inform me they purchase these duplicate homeowners policies for me thus I have no idea how many monthly payments they stole from my checking account. Wells Fargo has never provided me with any of this information and refuses to help resolve it or pay me back! I contacted Wells Fargo each time attempting to resolve these issues but they claimed they could do nothing and refused to do anything to resolve them. Each time Wells Fargo created non-authorized duplicate homeowners insurance policies that operated while my own homeowners policy was still operating. Wells Fargo stole these outrageous payments from my checking account and never informed me or paid me back. Wells Fargo stole money from me, caused me years worth of grief over these issues and damaged my credit report which caused me denial of coverage and much higher premiums... 

Well I am done requesting that you resolve this issue. My nexts complaint letters will be directly targeting the federal government agencies and courts that directed you to resolve your illegal account creations.

Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the United States, is struggling to repair its image after a scandal in which its employees created millions of credit card and bank accounts that customers had never requested. That crisis, which came to a head last year, toppled Wells Fargos chief executive and led to millions of dollars in fines.

The bank also stands accused of having made improper adjustments to the terms of the home loans of customers who were in bankruptcy, which Wells Fargo denies.

He also said he had made me his sole contact and that his "" handler '' would text me information to send to him once he was in XXXX so that he could access the XXXX account and send money through to my credit cards so I could take out cash advances and send them to him via bitcoins for him to conduct the project he was sent on assignment to do. Money started showing up in some of my credit card accounts and I was eventually sent a "" promissory agreement '' on what appeared to be real CIA letterhead so I went forward with using my Discover card for balance transfers from other credit cards so I could get cash advances from them to send bitcoins to him thinking I was helping not only him but our country. Eventually it became clear that it was a scam after all of the money sent through to my credit card accounts was sucked back out after I sent him the funds and did a couple of other things he asked me to do with the money sent through. 

I contacted Discover about this when I realized that it was likely a scam, saw all of the money he sent through to my Discover card had been sucked out after I did balance transfers. They told me I am responsible for the debt even though they authorized the release of funds while apparently the money he sent through was still processing. I also sent them the attached letter by registered mail a few weeks ago and have not heard back from them regarding how they would be able to at least reduce the debt and interest being charged, or hopefully release me from being responsible for the balance transfers that occurred during the time he was ending funds through and then sucking them back out.

They told me there was a note to contact loss prevention so I was transferred over to that department. Turns out a customer 's check I deposited XXXX days ago they wanted to verify. But he said the number they had for the customer was not a verified number so it was my responsibility to contact the customer and have her contact them to verify the check and then I was to call back after that and they would lift the restriction. There is a two and a half hour wait to get through to that department. So basically I can't access MY money, pay bills, buy gas or food because Chase Bank restricted my whole account for depositing a customer 's check. The check was from another chase business acct. Now I have to do their job and track this customer down so she can call them to verify her check. I was told while this restriction is in place all incoming transactions will be returned unpaid. Due to the 2XXXX  hour wait time this probably won't be resolved until tomorrow, but I'm at a gas station now on empty and need to get dinner for my family somehow.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,77089,,Consent provided,Web,2022-04-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5331844

On its website, I thought i've had setup autopay option for the card. But turned out, it was for the old closed credit card which is somehow still listed under my account ( there's no indication on the website that shows it has been closed, since the current active card and the defunct card is exactly the same type of card, it was confusing to see which is which to say the least ). Therefore the autopay didn't process correctly, and I was charged both late fee and interest charge. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted BoA. They were only able to reverse the late fee, but refused to reverse the interest charge. Although admitting have two cards w/ the same name that caused the confusion, especially when one of it is no longer active, which lead to the autopay wasn't being setup correctly. 

I've asked BoA 's technical team to finally removed the defunct card on the account to avoid any future confusion. And I have made the payment for the full balance since I have no intention to be late on payment. But BoA 's refusal on reversing the interest charge is not acceptable since it bears responsibility of the issue.
