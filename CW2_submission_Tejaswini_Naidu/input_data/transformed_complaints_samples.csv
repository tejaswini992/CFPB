I then mailed DISCOVER an adverse action letter addressing the denial ( Letter Attached ), in which I received no response from the financial institution. I do believe I was discriminated against, as I know my credit score has nothing to do with an approval.

I, the consumer, came to extend credit and not receive a loan from the U.S. Treasury. DISCOVER 's lack of willful full disclosure was the fraud of execution in conjunction with fraud of inducement brought forth by DISCOVER. I am aware that although I was told I was denied, the application was still deposited into the Federal Reserve Bank for notes. The Federal Reserve Act Section 16 parts 1 and 2 states this fact.

Unfortunately, the bank teller requested two forms of identification. Usually, when two forms of ID is requested, most commonly I've used my government issued identification card along with my social security card. The teller told me that the social security card wasn't a valid document for identification. I offered my birth certificate & the teller asked if I didn't have a card with my name on it. I stated that no I didn't, it was my first time opening a bank account. Therefore, I was denied to open a bank account, along with denied to have my SSI check cashed. Afterwards, I ended up to going to ACE Check Cashing. I had no problem cashing the check, requesting a prepaid card, & even opening an account with ACE ELITE PREPAID CARD. Including, I had deposit on my Ace Elite account {$1000.00}.

Where the same financial institution is misinforming their clients. She was upset & told the supervisor how can they work the way they do.

Your company has violated my rights multiple times. 

If I filed a complaint originally it was because you were breaking the law. 

Then you refuse my offer to settle debt, until I remove my complaint for you violating my federal rights in the first place. 

So I went to court. Your representative did not show up. 

The judge waited for hours. They still did not show up. 

I was told the case was closed. 

Today I am notified that you violated my credit. AGAIN. 

what happen to 90 days? XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX hmm What happen to forcing me to remove my complaint? 

You won't make a deal for repayment until I remove my complaint. I told you I wouldn't remove it. 

You can not force me to remove a complaint against you or your company. 

Then you no showed for court. I told the judge what you did. 

So please. 

If you would like to push this matter further. I would be glad to find a very over zealous attorney. 

This is now my 2nd official federal complaint against your company for violating laws that were put in place to protect individuals from companies like you. 

You refused to settle.

However, it is actually placed on hold for over 10 days so that they can verify the funds. I was told by Citi that this is an incredibly rare occurrence and that is a result of 1 ) the card being new ( it was opened in XXXX ) 2 ) the payments are large which triggers a fraud alert ( the largest payment has been a little over {$400.00} ) and 3 ) because I make more than one payment within the billing cycle ( this is true, I make a payment each time I get paid, so approximately every two weeks ). 

This is not incredibly rare but actually happens after every single payment, resulting in me not being able to access my money for 10+ days. Most recently, they put a hold on a {$330.00} payment that I made on XX/XX/XXXX. Funds left my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was a XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX was a XXXX Citi received funds the next business day, as they always have. 

My wife also makes payments throughout the billing cycle, as do many of her friends and colleagues. Her funds are not held for 10 days. The main difference between my wife, her friends, and me, is that I am XXXX and my last name makes that obvious. 

I have never once, since opening this card ( or at any point in recent memory ) had a payment not go through. My credit score is above XXXX. There is zero reason for them to still believe they will not receive their money. 

Citi is profiling me based on my name and assuming I dont have funds since I am a XXXX. This is egregious and appalling. There is no excuse for this XXXX XXXX and profiling.

I notified Pacific Premier bank regarding this issue. I asked if they could place a block on this company to prevent withdrawls from my account bc I had not given them my new debit card number on purpose. 

I was told by a Pacific Premier Bank gentleman who answers at customer service that he had placed a block on my account for this merchant. I said good thank you bc I don't know how they got my card number as I NEVER gave it to them. 

Later in XXXX I noticed a charge for this merchant and contacted Pacific Premier Bank. They told me they'd reverse it. 

I ended up in the hospital that month and was not dc 'd till the Middle of XXXX. I did not have my phone bc phones r banned in hospitals bc they can carry covid into the hospital. 

I noticed when I was dc 'd on my checking account That Pacific Premier Bank had allowed this company to withdraw money in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX even though they stated there was a block on this merchant. 

I called the merchant who stated they were reversing the charges but they never did. I asked them how they got the numbers for the last XXXX debit cards and they refused to give me this info. 

In XXXX my bank had finalized the merger with XXXX ( my original bank ) so they changed cards again. So why did Pacific Premier Bank allow charges on 2 cards that were never given to XXXX?! Especially if they told me there was a block on my account?!! 

Sounds fishy to me!!! Someone in Pacific Premier Bank is giving card numbers out to ppl.

191638,1989046,2023-02-01,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/2022, I received a phone call from the official Citibank Customer Service phone number ( the same number on the back of my debit card ). The person on the line stated he was a Citibank employee named XXXX XXXX. He told me that Citi noticed fraudulent activity on my account happening in Florida ( where I used to live ). 

He proceeded to ask me questions that Citi would typically ask such as the last 4 digits of my social, my address, and later on in the call, the first 5 digits of my SSN. Although I never gave him my banking login information, he was able to get into my account with the little information he had. He mentioned that he had the names of the scammers that got into my account and asked if I wanted to press charges with the help of Citis legal department. By this point, while I was still confused by what was really going on, I was more worried about these imaginary scammers and wanted to resolve the issue. I told him yes I would like to proceed with charges and then he reconnected the phone call through a different phone number from a XXXX, Texas area code. 

The person I was on the phone with went through my bank statement transactions as if to search for more suspicious behavior he started reading out past XXXX payments that Ive authorized previously. He read off a few past XXXX payments that are monthly recurring transactions. Specifically ones that were sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a trusted contact in my phone. While he was going through my account I went to the Citi banking app on my phone and noticed nearly half my money was gone. I asked him what was going on but he gave me an answer that didn't really make sense. He then asked me to verify the contact of XXXX XXXX by sending a verification code to his phone number and told me to read it off to him. 

With whatever hacking technology this scammer has, he was able to use my friend 's name as the receiver of this money but changed where the money was actually being sent to. XXXX gave me a notification that the money was actually being redirected to a XXXX XXXX. I do not know this person and I am assuming this is a fake name. 

There were a total of 4 transactions. One of {$10.00}, {$4500.00}, {$2500.00}, and {$1900.00} equalling a total of {$8900.00} that he claimed I was getting my refund of from the money that disappeared. In order to send off that much money, HE created 2 new checking accounts under my profile so that I would keep sending money without a limit. 

Ive been received countless letters of denial for my claim and appeals from Citi. The scammer was able to go incognito by covering his own name and using the name of someone I trust in order to trick me into sending my money to get my refund.

I have spoken to two of your agents today who stated that the address we sent the check to is in fact your east coast address where payments are processed- so in reality, your company taking longer to find and process payments has negatively impacted my credit and a possible home purchase which I was planning within the next three months. 


Additionally, we sent a second check on XX/XX/XXXX, to the second address you provided XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( see attached email messages we have been sending to the email address your representative provided when we told her we didn't own a fax, and which, according to the representative we spoke to today is NOT the correct way to communicate with the research department ). This second check should have been received already but also hasn't. 


I am enclosing both certified check stubs. I tried making the payment on the phone today and even sending in a wire transfer today and I was denied permission to do either. I am being penalized with certified payments only because one month, XXXX, was not processed due to you providing incorrect information. 


I would like a written explanation for why my credit is being affected by the fact that your representative has provided the wrong information to us, or that your department processing time is not optimal. This will help me fight the negative mark on my credit score with the credit bureau. 



I get calls from you repeatedly - but no one can help me expedite nor find a payment. There is no assistance to the issue and your representatives state that the group that we sent the first check to is impossible to reach and could have received the payment, but not have processed it yet. 


We will go ahead and cancel the XX/XX/XXXX check since the bank confirmed today that you never cashed it. 


Because we acted as instructed and in good faith, I would like your company to allow me to make the XXXX payment via the phone or via wire transfer. If not, we will have to send a second check for the XXXX payment ASAP and you will continue to add on fees and derogatory marks until you can process your own payment. There's a contract on the apartment as of today, XXXX XXXX XXXX and we need this account cleared. 


Please see all check stubs ( certified payment ) we have sent attached.

This is already affecting the credit reports. 
Please advise.

Thank you, XXXX On Mon, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : Hello, I hope all is well. 



I was asked to mail a certified check for my XXXX mortgage payment because there was an issue with my online payment. 



The person on the phone instructed me to make it out to XXXX ( I had to double check with the person that it was not to be made to PRMG and they confirmed ) and to mail it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Jersey XXXX for the amount of {$840.00}. If this information is incorrect, I encourage you to listen back to the line recording as I know all calls are monitored and recorded. 



The check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX in the mail for the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. 



I received a call on Friday XXXX that they have yet to receive the check and there is an outstanding balance on my account. Then the person on the phone notified me that I was given incorrect instructions because there is another address that these certified checks are to be mailed to. Can it be confirmed whether or not the check sent on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX 's rent has been received? I've attached a copy of the check for your reference. The account number was written on the envelope ( the bank was not able to add it to the check itself. ) I need my account to be in good standing. 



I recognize I also need to send a cashier 's check for XXXX 's rent and before sending it over, I'd like to confirm that it is to be made out to XXXX and it needs to be sent instead to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, New Jersey XXXX ( as I was instructed on Friday. ) I would appreciate a response today so that I can send out the check as soon as possible.

The application went smooth, I did it over the phone with a lender. It was sent over to underwriting, I submitted all requested documents. I got an email saying the title work and appraisal had been ordered. Then I got an email back saying they required me to have {$9000.00} in a savings account to be able to be approved for the loan. This was the first time during this entire process that this requirement had been brought up. I really thought it was strange. I only have about {$4000.00} in a savings, so they said they could not move forward with the loan. Had I known this up front, I never would have applied and took the hit on my credit. Obviously, I would have known I would not be approved. But this fact was never disclosed until the end, after the app, the credit pull, the entire process. A supervisor called me after I submitted a complaint on their website about this process. Then, after that, I got a call from the appraiser to schedule an appraisal, so I did that. Thinking maybe it was back on track again. We scheduled for today at XXXX XXXX. Well, the appraiser did not show. I called and she said the bank called her and cancelled it. So, I am really not sure what is going on. I think it is unacceptable that they effectively tricked me into applying for a loan I had no way of getting. And also during the process, the person that took my application on XXXX separate phone calls remarked how young I am. Which, I am XXXX, so I don't know why. But also, how is that relevant? Is that also part of why I was declined? My age?

All while still getting my information into their system and getting an application tick mark for their spreadsheets.

You had no permissible purpose by law to report this alleged debt and have violated 15 USC 1692g - Validation of debt because you failed to satisfy all 5 requirements, which states : ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.

I am not requesting a statement of generalized accounting, as this would NOT be accurate because it is NOT an authenticated record. I am demanding a request for accounting, pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), which is recognized as commercial law.

UCC Article 9-210 ( 2 ) is noted below.

9-210. REQUEST FOR ACCOUNTING ; REQUEST REGARDING LIST OF COLLATERAL OR STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT.

( a ) [ Definitions. ] In this section : ( 1 ) "" Request '' means a record of a type described in paragraph ( 2 ), ( 3 ), or ( 4 ).

( 2 ) "" Request for an accounting '' means a record authenticated by a debtor requesting that the recipient provide an accounting of the unpaid obligations secured by collateral and reasonably identifying the transaction or relationship that is the subject of the request.

If your agency is having a hard time understanding the law, my request for an accounting means the request for an accounting you provide me must be signed by someone under authority in order to VALIDATE/VERIFY the information in the instrument ; this is the meaning of what a record authenticated means. A record CAN NOT be authenticated without being signed by someone under authority. If you cant send me an actual ORIGINAL contract with my signature on it, you have no right furnishing this inaccurate information and not only have you violated my right to privacy, but youve violated various statutes of BOTH the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) simply by reporting this alleged debt. Im not sure if you know, but violations of these sections make you liable for at LEAST {$1000.00} per violation.

Even if you satisfy all 5 requirements, I am the one that has the right to verify whether it is my debt or not and as I have previously stated this is an ALLEGED debt that I do NOT owe. I have sustained defamation of my character as a result of this information and am demanding you to delete the above accounts from my consumer report.

Furthermore, I demand that you CEASE and DESIST all efforts to collect on this alleged debt and may only communicate with me further under the stipulations of sending me a letter with this alleged account deleted. 

You have 14 days to respond upon receipt of this letter to delete the negative items and send me a new letter, notifying me that the information has been deleted from all consumer reporting agencies.

I am a victim of identity- theft, I am writing to request that you block all accounts disputed as fraudulent on my credit reports with XXXX , XXXX , and XXXX. This information does not relate to any transactions I have made. I did not give anyone authorization or consent to use my personal information. I hereby exercise my legal rights enacted by Congress and The Federal Trade Commission, which explicitly states when a victim of identity-theft dispute a fraudulent account on his/her credit report it shall be honored by all credit bureaus and all fraudulent information should be blocked within 4 days and proper notification shall be given to all data furnishers pursuant to section 605b of The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply shall lead to complaints being filed with The XXXX XXXX XXXX, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Attorney General stating your companys unlawful collection practices, misrepresentation of creditworthiness, defamation of character, and noncompliance to abide by laws enacted by Congress to protect victims of identity-theft who's credit been impacted by acts of fraud. Because I know my rights under THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT, CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION ACT ( CCPA ), and FAIR and ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTION ACT of 2003 ( FACTA ). I will be taking action. 

I also know my rights under this paragraph of Section 312 of the FACTA LAW : SEC.312. Procedures to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. ( b ) duty of furnishers to provide accurate information. -- Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) of THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) is amended ( 1 ) in subparagraph ( A ), by striking "" knows or consciously avoids knowing the information is inaccurate '' and inserting "" knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate '', and ( 2 ) by adding at the end of the following : ( D ) DEFINITION -- For purposes of subparagraph ( A ), the term 'reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate ' means having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of information. 

Policy states. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy.

( a ) Reinvestigation ( 1 ) Reinvestigation ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. 

It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from my credit files. 


1. CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP bal. {$140.00} I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity theft.

1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from alleged identity theft, not later than four ( 4 ) busin
ess days after the date receipt by such agency of 1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to the transaction by the consumer.

I have provided all of the above listed four ( 4 ) items within this package. Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days. This is clearly an identity theft issue. I am also entitled to receive a free copy of my credit report, so I am requesting a free credit report and that all of these accounts, public records items, and inquiries be permanently blocked and deleted.

At the end of the program I was sent a letter asking me to agree to a short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. I am not going to agree with either one of those options. If I wanted to lose my home I wouldn't have even bothered with applying for the mortgage forebearance program in the first place. What kind of scam is this? I found this to look like a scam since they were not honoring the mortgage forbearance plan that the government said that they needed to provide. 

I am prepared to make the mortgage payments I used to do before the covid forbearance or better. 

I believe that the actions they are taking are predatory since my home has a good amount of equity. I need some assistance talking to these people to put the loan into a normal status and so they don't take my home from my kids and me.

126375,2092165,2021-11-11,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I am asking for your assistance in an attempt to resolve issue with BSI Financial due to no longer possessing the physical nor mental wear with all to deal with the noncompliance, misleading, misinformed, misguided, and degradation by some over several occasions ( more than 20 calls made from XXXX til now ) upon contacting BSI in an attempt to gain fill and signatures upon four forms ( initiate continuance of financial housing assistance/subsidy ) that have been submitted by way of fax, email ( downloaded to portal ), voice message request, third party submission via fax or email ( third info. given repeatedly ). The lack of cooperation in just sending an email, making a phone call or faxing County agency for clarity on what forms are, there function, and proper preparation has been totally ignored in spite of numerous request to reach out to the agency , County of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX housing specialist II in order to receive much needed assistance to be paid out to BSI Financial per mortgage payment. This assistance is called Section 8 Homeownership assistance. Unfortunately BSI Financial bought out a loan that was and has been receiving ongoing mortgage assistance since its inception via the County of XXXX ( HUD affiliated ). In doing so, the County of XXXX is in need of four forms to be filled out by BSI in order to continue assisting property : Housing specialist XXXX XXXX informed me as of late XX/XX/2021 via email that she had not received any response back in her reaching out via phoning and faxing BSI in an attempt to have forms completed.She sent me forms needed and asked if I could attempt to gain a contact person, stated will do. I faxed the forms myself along with phoning for who contact person was for the task at hand was given XXXX XXXX per XXXX as confirmed individual-fax request was addressed to her along with program and XXXX XXXX information in the case there was a need for clarity, any other questions, or for return. I phoned XXXX and gave contact info. given for XXXX XXXX. I phoned back after XXXX XXXX was told via cstmr. care rep. XXXX upon him contacting XXXX XXXX that she did receive the faxed forms and that she was not the contact but in fact loss mitigation and that forms would be sent to Legal dept. on that day. She had not acknowledged forms ( nor reached out ) that were faxed to her on XX/XX/XXXX. I was instructed by XXXX to give it 14 days, phone back for status, so I did. Upon phoning back I was told there is no legal confirmed XXXX XXXX is the individual over account that had just been acquired as of XX/XX/2021. I have left several messages for XXXX XXXX ( will not respond nor allowed to speak with anyone of authority directly ) along with housing specialist XXXX XXXX, with no response to us both. Thereafter I was told to download the forms ( forms that had been faxed twice by way of myself and XXXX ) to my portal-I complied. After which I inquired if now they be completed I was told they need to be completed by you, which was incorrect ; asked that the Housing Authority of the County of XXXX be contacted for authenticity, refused, betrayed by yet another cstmr. rep.. I would hang up and dial BSI two times a week phoning three times each on each day ( six calls a week ) speaking with different reps.each time receiving variations in information pertaining to the four forms-variably lied to that theyd be completed, legal would do it, I need to apply for XXXX, they are very familiar with forms, wrong forms have been sent and the falsehoods continue : my worse nightmare! This has went on for the last months up til last phone call made as of XXXX. Spoke to as if youre non viable, degradated by not all but most. When asked to speak with a supervisor due to the importance of these forms to my livelihood blocked! If asked why wont someone just phone XXXX for explanation and the how to since they were totally unaware of proper handling, refused an answer or lied to. Told she was phoned would ask when was unable to provide a date nor time when act was committed not to mention each time I phoned BSI I would phone XXXX XXXX on whatever non update I received, shed state each time no one has contacted her. I was told XXXX was supervisor ( given her name on two occasions with extension once-left message no response back. I was hung up on after discussion and awaiting transfer to supervisor or always told unavailable. I was never allowed to speak with legal, XXXX XXXX, XXXX nor any manager to receive clarity in proper handling of situation or recourse. At this point I wanted to know if it could be completed or not, continually stated shall be done and that XXXX XXXX is the person. Many argumentative phone calls later, I spoke with a cstmr. rep. who actually seemed to care about what I was sayin she reached out to a manager ( had become common that I can not speak directly to anyone of authority. She confirmed yet again that XXXX XXXX is the overseer and that I place a third party authorization on my account for XXXX XXXX and all county entities and HUD, so I did. Upon my second phone call made to BSI on the date of XXXX, I stated to the cstmr. rep. that I have no recourse but to file a discriminatory non compliance in the handling of my new account via BSI Financial with CFPB. I expressed how Ive written/expressed the validity of funds needed to sustain my mental/physically very medically fragile adult son and the threat theyre posing to sustaining housing for a family of meager means but more importantly my adult son receiving this precious assistance keeps him in home and safe from being convalescence during a time that would not only be costly but deadly in his circumstance. I am trying to literally just keep a roof over our heads during these troubling times. BSI has introduced financial strife and threat to my doing so-Im paying full mortgage payment out of pocket on time so far in spite the need for the continued assistance. The mental angst is strongly felt as my son and myself are being discarded, not considered viable by this company. My greatest wish would be for my loan to be twice removed from this company but being told can not be done til sixth month, so meantime I would wish for my loan to be handled by someone else, not XXXX XXXX. I attempted to file a complaint via CFPB on XXXX as I gave information was told that rep. XXXX computer had timed out saving none of what was stated to her by myself, I wanted to give up! But I can not, I have to fight for my son and all those like him and in a situation as mines. My son is very ill as I write this, I am exhausted and scared. I made a last stab attempt on XXXX just to see if BSI would be kind they were not, told they have nothing to do with past events told once again that forms would be sent to legal per supervisor XXXX conveyed by an unforgiving cstmr. rep. XXXXhis rude reinvigorated me to reach out and ask sincerely for your assistance in helping me continue sustaining my sons life by way of this appreciated assistance received from HUD via the Housing Authority of the County of XXXXand of course your agency due to helping recent past. Any information you can help provide me in resolution will be solely appreciated-I am at a complete stalemate with this deceptive company. No one of meager means with health issues should be treated so unjustly its inhumane. I just want to ensure if I were to precede my son in death that he has a safe place to reside, they are working against this reality-its shaming.

I struggled in a tough market and decided to take my safe test and get into mortgages to have more job security. I started a home modification last year with freedom mortgage along with submitting info to XXXX  in hopes of getting back on track. Ive been back and forth with freedom mortgage. XXXX set of docs they sent out had my ex husbands name and I said he was not on the deed and needed to be removed and sent in deed to show he was not on XXXX said I was still protected in loss mitigation. This has gone on for months! I kept following up monthly with a different banker giving me the same story that I was protected. I got a statement in XXXX to make a payment and I called to do so and the banker told me a different amount then what I had and gave me some story. Then said I didnt need to make the payment at all as I was still in mitigation. I went ahead and paid {$1500.00} as it was the holidays and figured I was still protected that I could use the extra money for XXXX. My docs came in and I signed and had had them notorized thinking my XXXX payment would be XX/XX/XXXX. I called to make my new payment and was told I was to start making those payments in XX/XX/XXXX and owed around XXXX on top of my new XXXX XXXX. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor and was directed to XXXX XXXX who said he would be my point of contact since no one was giving me the correct info. A few days after I spoke with XXXX  I received intent to foreclose on my home and I reached out to XXXX  who said it was a standard letter not to worry. Ive reached out to XXXX  multiple times since trying to get updates regarding the XXXX and no response. I received new docs to sign this wk to sign with my XXXX XXXX  name again on the statement. Since I had sent XXXX additional emails to XXXX  with no response I sent another stating that I would go above him if I didnt get answers as to whats going on and still no response. I reached out to XXXX back in XXXX where my status as of XX/XX/XXXX still says under review and they responded to be patient.

116367,2114438,2021-08-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have a mortgage account through SunTrust / Truist. I have never missed a payment. I owe a lot less than my home is worth, so I have been attempting to have the PMI removed from my payments. I have been attempting this for several months, starting back in XX/XX/XXXX. I have attempted to contact them online a number of times over the past months. When online didn't work, I called them. The lady on the phone told me exactly what to do - that they need the request in writing. She instructed me to either fax it in, or to log in to my online account and send it as a secure message - either method would work. So, while on the phone, I did just that - logged in and sent a secure message. It was ignored - that was XX/XX/XXXX, still no response. After a month, I decided to go in person. I went in and was instructed that nobody at Suntrust ever pays any attention to secure messages, and no, they had no idea that I had asked about that request. They then said they couldn't even help me submit the request. I would have to go home, write a hand written letter, and then fax it. To which number? The bank person could not even tell me a fax number to send it to. He said that there are so many he wouldn't know. So, I went home. I hand wrote a letter. I then returned to the branch and asked the teller to figure out the fax number and fax it directly from themselves to themselves so there would be no further delay or issue. That was on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I still have received no responses - from any of the many attempts I have made. This is unethical and frustrating. We have been following exactly what they've told us to do at every step but those steps don't get us anywhere, and then other employees of the bank tell us those steps were incorrect and don't get you anywhere. 

We experienced the same thing last year when covid hit and they sent us a bunch of spam snail mail about how they worked with people to defer mortgage payments up to three months. Yes - they used the word defer. Not forbearance. When we tried and tried to get help, they refused to respond. No matter what we tried, nobody anywhere could tell us who to call or how to contact anyone. No response to secure messages, couldn't get through after hours on hold, nothing. 

Similarly, and shockingly, in XX/XX/XXXX, we had to file to keep our 4 % tax residential rate. Instead of giving us the correct rate, SunTrust went ahead and charged us for that 6 % tax rate to create a bigger escrow, even though we clearly didn't need it and we had contacted them by phone and in person to make sure they knew about it ahead of time. They ignored all of that and went ahead and charged us an extra {$500.00} a month on our mortgage payment - with no way to pay any less than the full amount, there is no field for manually typing in how much to pay, it's either the full amount or zero - for the excess tax we did NOT owe - and we only got them to fix it in XXXX! They charged us an extra {$500.00} for months - thank god we can afford that. What happens to people who can't? There's still a fee sitting on there that I refuse to pay from this - me trying to figure out why I was being so ridiculously overcharged and again getting no responses - they need to make this right.

My direct deposit from my employment went to First Tech FCU, my mortgage payments were automatically paid thru my checking account. The bank failed to make my mortgage payment for XX/XX/2022 because they closed my account without notice. My excellent payments with my mortgage were negatively affected as a result. 
According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, First Tech FCU violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) when they garnished the entire amount of funds available in my checking account in the amount of {$4000.00}. without a court ordered judgement, & without proper notice. 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS I could no longer access my bank statements when my account had been closed. 
The bank was demanding full payment in an amount above the amount owed without reducing the unauthorized funds that First Tech FCU had garnished from my account. I did not agree to the demands and the banks agent wanted in the amount of {$650.00} a month ( previously {$300.00} a month ).

This ends up overdrafting numerous accounts. 
As a former Online banking Phone banker, I tried to inform them numerous times that this seemed to be a UDAAP violation because the bank processes the request and it shows on internal records days before it gets processed and shows as a transaction on the online logs the customer can see. The managers at the bank simply dismissed the concerns, stating that I should just advise callers to keep a written record on their own to avoid fees because the online banking was just a tool and not an actual transaction log. 
This is maliciously deceptive as it leads to regular and numerous overdrafts for any customer relying on the online banking to track spending in their daily lives. Furthermore, debit card transactions show as "" pending '' once the authorization request is sent to the bank until the final authorization is submitted to the bank abd finalized. This same system could easily be implemented to reflect a "" pending '' ach transaction until it's finalized and approved to prevent millions of overdraft charges ( since the date is what the bank uses to determine if they will charge an OD fee and is usually retroactive ) that could easily be prevented if the banks were genuinely concerned about helping their customers like they claimed, instead of nickel and diming customers for the sake of adding millions to their bottom line.

My tax refund for XXXX was deposited in said account. So again my XXXX refund was deposited in the same account. Fraudulent charges were made on the account and card is no longer in my possession. So I file a claim. While waiting for the claim to be investigated I had called in to check the status. I was then told I was not myself, XXXX XXXX. I then lost online access to my account. I was asked to provide identification, which I immediately sent in. The following day I received an email stating my account was closed. After that date of being told my account was closed, my stimulus payment was deposited. I later received a letter stating the claim is now closed. Errors were found and any provisional credits given to me were now permanent. I then contact the IRS because I was unaware it had been sent to Netspend. They advise me that it was and that its very odd they havent received it back of the account were closed that banks are to send any deposits made to a closed account back within 7-10 days. I contact Netspend regarding the money that the claims were made about and why I havent received a check. They have told me over 3 dozen times that it is being investigated by their fraud team. But the claims already been decided in my favor? They also are investigating my stimulus deposit. But my account was closed so it should have been sent back? 
So whats happening is Netspend is not able to differentiate the two IRS deposits and are leaving me without my money. They are also illegally holding deposits made to a closed account. Ive contacted them by email and phone around 70 times and no one is ever able to assist me. They will not release my money to me. Ive contacted corporate and they have not helped either.

198990,166534,2023-03-11,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I have been a Wells Fargo customer for many years. I accepted a credit card from them several years ago. They continually increased my credit limit to the extent that I can not possibly continue to pay the card and afford everyday living expenses. After consulting a consumer banking expert, I learned that the limit Wells Fargo allowed was far in excess of what should have been allowed for someone of my income level. My limit was in the {$10000.00} range for a long time and I needed additional credit to pay for college tuition and afford to take care of my toddler. Wells granted me a limit of {$16000.00}. Many months later, I surpassed that limit and was allowed to run the balance up to nearly {$26000.00} without any discussion about increasing my limit. My assumption was that if they were willing to increase my limit, then I must be able to afford the new debt because I know banks are required to have the best interest of their clients in mind. On XX/XX/XXXX I met with my Wells Fargo Branch team to discuss the situation and brought my consumer banking expert. They did not have the authority to propose any solutions so they got their complaint desk on the phone. The lady on the phone essentially told me I was completely responsible because I got my statements and should have known better. At this point, my banking expert asked the person on the phone if she or anyone else at Wells Fargo took the time to underwrite the additional credit. She responded that as long as clients continue to make at least the minimum payment, Wells Fargo assumes they can handle the credit. To put this in perspective, my Adjusted Gross Income in XXXX, the year that would have been used to review my credit worthiness, was just over {$19000.00}. We asked the complaint line person how they could underwrite giving me up to nearly {$26000.00} ( 160 % of the assigned limit ) in unsecured revolving credit with an AGI of {$19000.00}. The answer was the same as above, if you pay on time, they give you more. I am willing to accept some responsibility for using the additional money, but I also feel like I was allowed to put myself in this position with Wells Fargo as my partner in the situation. Several communications have taken place on the phone and responses by letter since that time where the same point that, "" Wells Fargo provides your account with a baseline level of credit to be utilized. As a customer who continuously makes on-time payments, Wells Fargo believes that the customer is reputable for the funds. '' My Consumer Banking Expert finds this statement incredulous. Finally, after several conversations with various complaint personnel at XXXX, I sent a certified letter to the complaint department and copied ( also certified ) XXXX XXXX ( XXXX of XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further formalizing my complaint and asking for them to properly propose some way we can resolve this issue so that I can pay a fair amount of the debt, but also having WFC acknowledge their failure with some sort of accommodation. I gave them until XX/XX/XXXX to satisfy my request for a meaningful dialogue on how we can settle this dispute. I am under tremendous financial pressure as I have spent my daughter 's entire college savings of $ XXXX and most of my disposable monthly income trying to reduce this debt. Essentially, in trying to pay down the Wells Fargo debt, I still owe my young daughter the money I used to pay down the card. There should be some compassion by a large financial institution for a customer trying to do the right thing and pay the debt, but there seems to be no willingness by Wells Fargo to help in any way. Many people would just establish a bank account elsewhere and stop paying the card balance and let them charge it off and have their credit score suffer for 3 years. It seems that my unwillingness to completely default, gains no favor with this large and insensitive institution. Lastly, my consumer banking expert advises me that these "" credit models '' they have developed are supposed to take into account all compliance issues including fairness to the customer, and burying a customer in debt is NOT serving the customer and is not in Compliance with banking Consumer Compliance laws. Their credit models need to be fully investigated because if they are not sufficiently measuring capacity to afford debt, how could they also be sufficiently checking for other consumer compliance issues such as ECOA violations, etc.?

121316,616933,2021-09-30,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"( Please do not allow Wells Fargo to close this complaint before it is actually resolved this time. ) Complaint # XXXX was closed by Wells Fargo without them providing all of the information requested. There are also misinterpretations and outright falsehoods in their responses. 
I have the absolute right to have an honest and accurate response to my complaint. 
I have the absolute right to have accurate notes on my Wells Fargo account. 

I have collected the inaccuracies and missing information below. 
I. Inaccuracies in Wells Fargo mortgage account notes II. Review of what is visible on CFPB website ( Complaint # XXXX ) III. Response to file attachment from XX/XX/XXXX ( Complaint # XXXX ) IV. Missing Information ( Complaint # XXXX ) CONCLUSION I. Review of account notes I requested from Wells Fargo Wells Fargo must add notes to my account that are accurate. The first thing representatives do when I call Wells Fargo is review my account notes. When they are not accurate, they must be corrected. 

There are several important inaccuracies in my account notes. 
1. ) This is a note on my account dated XXXX : "" CUSTOMER IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER PAYMENT ASSISTANCE DUE TO DELINQUENT STATUS AT THE TIME OF DISASTER DECLARATION '' This is absolutely not true. 
All that is necessary is to look at my Payment History from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX to know that this is false. 

2. ) See the note on my account dated XXXX I have an approved {$20000.00} grant to help with the forbearance amount. But, Wells Fargo has a grant amount of {$2000.00} in the note, not the actual amount of {$20000.00}. 

Wells Fargo has refused to consider the grant when I have applied for a loan modification. This grant would be applied to the forbearance amount. 

3. ) See the notes on my account dated XXXX and XXXX ( basically the same note twice ) These notes say Re-Entry did not have my documents. This is not accurate. 
I provided all the documents they requested. 
There is contradictory information regarding my HUD representative. First it says they have no authorization from him, then they state that there is a written authorization to release information, all in the same note. 
Also, I have always provided all documents that have been requested in a timely manner. Any statement otherwise is inaccurate. 

4. ) See note on my account from XXXX The name and contact information for a supervisor in the XXXX XXXX was never provided. 

5. ) See note on my account from XXXX I am fairly sure this note was entered by someone named XXXX. 
I tried calling him back at least 3 times during business hours before XXXX. He never answered, and his voicemail was not set up. I could never leave a message for him. 

6. ) See note on my account from XXXX I faxed the request for the underwriter specifics including all the information considered in making a final decsion regarding the loan modificaation. I was told to do by XXXX in Re-Entry, and I faxed the request on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have still not received that information. 


II. Review of what is visible on CFPB website ( Complaint # XXXX ) Again, Wells Fargo must put accurate information in their responses. 
1. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo makes a statement, "" We`ve been unable to establish contact with our customer, XXXX XXXX XXXX ... '' This is not accurate. 
Here is the timeline ( calls between me and Wells Fargo re : CFPB complaint ) : XXXX WF rep called to introduce herself and provide contact information. 
XXXX WF rep called again to introduce herself and provide contact information. 
XXXX called her back and left a message, saying I received her messages and to call me if she has questions about the complaint. 
XXXX called her after reading the XX/XX/XXXX response ; no answer. I left message of the inaccuracy stated above. 
XXXX called her again after reading the XX/XX/XXXX response ; no answer ; nor return call. I left message of the inaccuracy stated above. 
XXXX called her again after reading the XX/XX/XXXX response ; no answer ; nor return call. I left message of the inaccuracy stated above. 

2. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, part of Wells Fargo 's response is visible on the CFPB website outside of the file attachment. 
( a ) It does not address the in accuracy of the statement, We`ve been unable to establish contact with our customer, XXXX XXXX XXXX ... '', even though I called at least 3 times to have it corrected ( see Timeline in II.1. ) above ). 
Wells Fargo seems to add things on the record to make themselves look better. 
Wells Fargo should be concerned about accurate and complete reporting. 

( b ) It states that Wells Fargo had already spoken to me about the response as of its posting on XX/XX/XXXX. 
This is inaccurate. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX called on XXXX said the response had been posted on the CFPB complaint. I was not home at the time, and I told her I would review it that evening. We did not speak about the response until XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX XXXX. After talking, we scheduled a time to talk more on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX. 
She was supposed to call me. When I did not her from her, I called her, but she did not answer. I left a message, which included asking her to call me later the same day. 
I have not heard back from anyone. 

Once again, Wells Fargo must not report inaccuracies. 
This complaint was closed before I had a chance to review it and speak to a Wells Fargo representative about it. 
Also, how is it fair for Wells Fargo to be able to close a complaint before their customer even has time to review their response? That should never be allowed. 

( c ) It states that my documents did not meet the requirements ( for a loan modification, I assume ) on XX/XX/XXXX. 
What about the documents sent to Re-Entry after XX/XX/XXXX for re-consideration for loan modification? 
There were updates made multiple times after XX/XX/XXXX, including the {$20000.00} grant from the XXXX XXXX XXXX organization. This grant has not been considered. 
I have faxed a written request for the detail numbers and other factors associated with the denial in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have not received that information. 


III. Response to file that Wells Fargo attached to the CFPB response from XX/XX/XXXX ( Complaint # XXXX ) 1. ) "" Credit Reporting Information '' This is about a note on my account dated XXXX : "" CUSTOMER IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER PAYMENT ASSISTANCE DUE TO DELINQUENT STATUS AT THE TIME OF DISASTER DECLARATION '' The Wells Fargo response addressed this as if it were about credit reporting. It was not. 

Someplace in Wells Fargo 's system, my account was designated as "" XXXX '' in XX/XX/XXXX. 
How is that possible? 
Check my Payment History from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I paid the full amount due, either early or on-time each of those months. How as my account assigned a "" DELINQUENT '' status? 

I am sure this Wells Fargo error is a significant portion of the reason why I have been denied a loan modification. 
I need to know how that error occurred. And it must be corrected in your system and in my account notes. 

2. ) "" Re-entry Review Information '' First sentence in third paragraph : "" Please note, we did not receive the documents to show that you were now receiving border rental income .... '' This is inaccurate. This information has been faxed to Re-Entry multiple times. 
The last time I reviewed the documents was on a call with XXXX in Re-Entry on XXXX. At that time, she verified that they had what they needed. 
But, if more information was needed, someone in that department could have just called me and asked for more information. 

3. ) "" Service complaint explanation '' Of course, it is a legitimate complaint now. 
But originally, it was only a inquiry : a Request for Information in order to understand how Wells Fargo does business. 
An inquiry should not be automatically be labeled a "" SERVICE COMPLAINT ''. 

4. ) "" Wells Fargo website '' ( a ) It was stated in the response, "" Your particular investor only allowed up to 6-months of forbearance. '' I was told on a phone call from Wells Fargo that the investor allowed 9 months of forbearance. So, one of these communications from Wells Fargo is inaccurate. 

( b ) But, this response ( ( a ) above ) still does not address my original question. I did not ask about the number of months of forbearance allowed by the investor. My question was : Why was my forbearance amount not added to the end of my loan, as stated on the Wells Fargo website when I chose the forbearance option? I keep asking this question of Wells Fargo ( this is the fourth time ), and I have yet to receive an answer. 


IV. Things still not addressed in the CFPB complaint I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX ( Complaint # XXXX ) 1. ) This is a note on my account from XXXX : RE-ENTRY REVIEW OUT OF SCOPE I have no idea what this Note means. 
Please provide an explanation of what this means. 

2. ) This part of my request was not addressed. I asked for specifics. 
What were the numbers used to make the most recent decision to deny my request for a loan modification? 
I have the legal right to know the loan amount, interest rate, term, etc. used to come to the decision. 
I faxed a request for this information on XXXX. XXXX in Re-Entry gave me a new fax number ( XXXX ) that stayed busy, so the person at the branch asked me if I had another number. I faxed the request for these specifics on the same day to XXXX. 

3. ) This request for clarification was not answered. 
A few years ago, my account number was changed by Wells Fargo. I asked Wells Fargo : ( a ) Why was my account number changed? 
( b ) What does "" XXXX '' before my account number designate? 
( c ) Do all of Well Fargo 's mortgage account numbers begin with "" XXXX ''? 
Or do all of Well Fargo 's mortgage account numbers begin with "" XXXX '', "" XXXX '', or end with "" XXXX '' or "" XXXX ''? 
( d ) If not, which accounts do? 

4. ) One of the Wells Fargo "" Home Preservation Specialists '' offered to "" help me '' with a short sale in three different conversations. 
Surely, some type of ethics violation occurred, because I know that Wells Fargo is held to some type of standard in advising its customers. 
To push a short sale in the current housing market was, if not illegal, extremely irresponsible and predatory on the part of Wells Fargo. 

5. ) I requested the name and contact information for a supervisor of the Executive Office representative who did the first incomplete report regarding my initial Request for Information earlier this year. 
I never received the name and contact information. 

CONCLUSION 1. ) Any and all inaccuracies must be corrected in my Wells Fargo account notes. These are what their representatives read when making assessments about me and my loan. They must be accurate. 
2. ) I have asked for some of this information four times. This is information about me, the customer. Wells Fargo must provide all that I have requested.

3. ) I have provided enough information to justify a loan modification multiple times, but I have been denied multiple times. Wells Fargo has refused to lower the interest rate to allow a loan modification, and they have refused to consider the approved {$20000.00} grant toward the forbearance amount.

The 2nd time Upgrade closed my dispute was because the merchant allegedly told them it was a valid charge and they attempted to fix the issue but it was not followed. I followed their instructions and they were not able to fix the problem ; but Upgrade still sided with them. I was not treated fairly by Upgrade. When I would call them, the reps would keep me on hold for very long periods of time. One rep named XXXX hung up on me. XXXX and XXXX who works in escalations promised to call me back with resolution but never returned my calls. Upgrade told me the merchant stated they will resolve on their end and to call the merchant. I spoke to XXXX, the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX who stated her company sided in my favor and that my refund was sent back to Upgrade. She even sent me an email stating this. I sent a copy of the email to Upgrade and was told that even though the merchant mentioned that Upgrade should refund me and that they no longer have my funds, Upgrade told me that what was sent was a copy of the chargeback and not the refund. They said I need to go back to the merchant for resolution. I called the merchant today and spoke with XXXX. After XXXX read the email that XXXX sent me which was noted on their files, XXXX rudely and abruptly hung up on me. My money is in limbo. At this point, I don't know who to believe.

I feel that this is a way to assure consistency within my dispute, and unlike the companies I have contacted I do not want any discrepancies in what has occurred, what I have requested, submitted and above all what has been an empty search with no help. This assures everyone receives the full and unbiased information. 
I am very unhappy and am appalled at the disconcern towards me and my dilemma. 
I purchased XXXX prepaid cards from the local XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in my area. I had closed a bank account and needed to pay my rent. We always do that digitally online and mostly thru XXXX. 
I inquired to great lengths about the cards as I am not all that familiar and was assured that 2 cards would be uploaded with my funds that I could use now or at a later date. I purchased a net spend visa and a net spend XXXX. The attendant took my XXXX per card and gave me a receipt for the transaction. ( enclosed here ) I also received a smiths receipt that also showed the transaction. I thanked her and left. 
I had opened the XXXX card to get a closer look to see if it was like the one the XXXX service sent me. Then put both back in my purse and went home to sleep for a few hours as I worked graveyards. 
I went to work and planned on sending the money on the cards to pay the rent when I had my lunch break. I was a XXXX  so I have a private area and a shelve I keep my things on. 
When I went to my purse at my lunchtime the cards were gone and all that remained was the back to the XXXX card I had opened remained. I immediately notified my supervisor and in the morning before I left I told the secretary at the front desk and she said if she saw or heard anything she would notify me. This was the morning of the XXXX. Later that day after I was home I contacted XXXX. ( the number on the receipt. I was told then they had no way of tracing the cards or could they stop payment. I could not get the card numbers either. I thought that odd as they were the ones who loaded the cards so somehow, they had the info to send the money. But they said no. They said call Net spend and I could be refunded. I did. They said they have no way of knowing the cards ( Even though I have a verification link and number to show the cards were loaded ) and until they were used the numbers on the cards were going to be unknown. Now I was mad and my next time I could do anything was the day after the next, I think it was the XXXX or XXXX. I went to the store, ( XXXX ) and inquired there. The manager was very rude and said to me quote I dont know what your trying to do but you are not walking out of here with a XXXX dollars I was blown away. They had my money! I wasnt trying to get a refund either. Only asking to buy new cards so I could get MY money. So it was shocking but she contacted someone corporate and wow,, they had the card numbers. But would not give me the exp dates or the sec num. so I was told to call net spend again. I did. They still deny any knowledge of the cards and said I didnt have the correct 16 digit num . also be carful because the store was lying to me. huh? This was getting even more frustrating. So again I called smiths. ( XXXX ) and again every day they referred me to the other. I got mad and on the XXXX, I went to XXXX corporate office here in XXXX XXXX. The doors are locked, I see people inside but I was ignored. I called again from the parking lot and again the same old run around but this time I was told that the credit card numbers they provided me with were not the actual 16 digit numbers to my cards. But I do know from the receipt they match the last 4 numbers. Each transaction had the 4 last numbers of the card. So I do not know what to do now. 
The biggest problem is I am now being evicted from my apt and my landlady thinks im a deadbeat. She doesnt believe the companies would do this and I must agree XXXX quite shocked myself. I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX mother who lives with me and XXXX is having a place to live or not. They dont care, but worst of all is I PAID THEM TO TAKE MY MONEY. No one will even tell me who has it. 
So what can I do??? Can anyone help? Can I sue them if I end up on the streets? And that is possible, we have no living relatives here. I am scared and dont know why this is being done to me/.

I am trying to refinance my home. I just found out in XXXX that my credit score has gone down significantly because of two 30 days past due claims by my mortgage company in XXXX and XXXX. This was a surprise to me considering I never missed a payment. Since the origination of my loan my payments have been between XXXX and XXXX per month. I always pay XXXX just to insure I am paying above the amount of the mortgage. 
In XXXX. I received a letter stating that I was going to have forced insurance if I did not provide proof of insurance. In XXXX. I had my insurance provider send proof of insurance. Assuming that the problem had been resolved I continued to make my payment as usual. 
My mail is not reliable, so I was not aware that fifth third bank had misplaced the proof of insurance and raised my payments up until I got a phone call from fifth third bank notifying me of my partial payments in which I immediately brought the account current. I had my insurance company resend my proof of insurance and the problem was corrected and they mailed me a reimbursement check. I assumed that because they were willing to correct their mistake they would also correct their credit reporting but I was mistaken. 
In XXXX they said that I was an entire month delinquent. Upon further investigation it was determined that my regular payment was not being recognized because it was a partial payment due to an escrow adjustment that I was not aware of. This was corrected and I immediately brought my account current. 
Because of this confusion they reported to the credit bureau two thirty days past due claims. I asked them to correct this, and they said they could not because the shortages were not because of the mistake they made on my insurance, but rather the escrow adjustment. I feel this was an unfair reporting since I was working on resolving an insurance dispute with them at the same time as these adjustments were made. They have since adjusted my escrow back to its original amount.

Despite providing substantial evidence of the fraudulent transactions to both the bank and the XXXX Police Department, Bank of America denied my claim, citing that the card was used with the chip and/or PIN entered, and thus implying that I was responsible for the charges. 

The fraudulent transactions occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2023, and I reported them to the XXXX Police Department as part of a financial fraud investigation ( Case No : XXXX ). The total amount of the unauthorized charges is {$1300.00}. A detailed list of these transactions has already been submitted to the XXXX Police Department for investigation. 

According to the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), I am protected from liability for unauthorized charges on my credit card account. The FCBA limits my liability to {$50.00} for unauthorized charges, and many credit card issuers, including Bank of America, have a zero-liability policy for fraudulent charges. Despite this legal protection, Bank of America denied my claim and decided to remove the temporary credits applied to my account. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and investigate the unjust denial of my claim by Bank of America. I believe that the bank 's decision to hold me responsible for the fraudulent charges, despite the evidence provided, is in violation of the FCBA and the zero-liability policy. 

Please find the attached documents, including the list of fraudulent transactions and the letter I received from Bank of America, for your reference. Please note that in my attached documents I have provided account numbers. None of these account numbers are still active, so this information may be shared. I am willing to provide any additional information or evidence required to support my complaint.

169291,1740685,2022-09-29,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"This complaint is a culmination of a series of events that have transpired since XXXX of 2022. I had called citibank customer service on the last week of XX/XX/2022 to dispute charges that were made by XXXX and was given by the representative one dispute case number despite indicating and confirming with her that there were three transactions in total amounting to {$1900.00}. The breakdown of the transactions are as follows : {$1700.00}, {$170.00} and {$20.00}. Two letters from Citibank were generated and sent to me dated XXXX XXXX. The letter dated XX/XX/2022, informed me that my dispute has been opened for the {$1700.00} and the {$170.00} transactions. The 2nd letter, requested information regarding the disputed transaction for the {$170.00}. The letter stated that more information about the details of the inquiry was needed to obtain credit and for me to send an email or a signed letter explaining the dispute in detail and to include any related documentation. The letter also stated that IF I have a credit slip, credit memo or credit notification from the merchant, that I should include it. I sent a detailed lengthy letter to XXXX providing the details and reason for my dispute and attached several documentations to substantiate my reason to dispute the charges. Then another letter dated XX/XX/2022 that pertained to the {$1700.00} transaction arrived asking for more information to "" help with the investigation '' particularly a credit slip again. I called customer service and asked to be transferred to the dispute department to confirm that they have received my letter which i was told that they did and that a credit will be provided back to my account for both the {$1700.00} and the {$170.00} but they no mention of the {$20.00} which I was told after will also be processed. Upon the receipt of the letter, I immediately wrote to XXXX to tell them that all pertinent information and documentation has already been submitted in my XXXX email to them. On the XXXX of XXXX, another letter requesting for the same information was sent to me so i called again to confirm that my letter was received and that an investigation regarding the issue is being done. I was told that there was no update yet regarding the investigation to my dispute. Then a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX arrived telling me that "" since you can not provide proof the purchase was paid for using a payment method other than your account '', the {$170.00} provisional credit will be debited from my account. Confused by the letter, I, again, called customer service on the XXXX of XXXX and after being asked to explain the reason for my calling and explaining to the representative who claimed to be from the dispute department, my situation and getting a response that made me confused even more, I asked for a supervisor and was forwarded to a certain XXXX who then told me that the confusion resulted because I was not provided the proper Dispute claim numbers for each transaction namely the {$170.00} and the {$20.00} and that the documentation I sent was only applied to the {$1700.00} amount, which contradicts the first letter sent on XXXX documenting 2 amounts. He provided me with two more Dispute Claim numbers for the other amounts and instructed me to send another email appealing the result of the case and for it to be reopened and that he will also send a letter explaining the situation to whoever is handling the case. He also said that once the appeal is processed, the amount will be credited back to my account. I sent the letters with the corresponding reference numbers and included the original letter I sent together with the attachments since they all pertained to the same case I was disputing overall. After checking my account if the {$170.00} was credited back as i was told and not seeing it, I called to inquire again and this time I spoke to another supervisor called XXXX who informed me that the credit should have placed back in my account already but that there was no information regarding it was noted. He said that he will send an email to the people responsible for this and that he will call me back 24 to 48 hours from then between the hours of XXXX and XXXX EST to update me. Waited for his call but never heard from him again. Please note that at this point in time, I could not trust the words of any of the representatives and I also began to have doubts that my emails were being thoroughly read and the attachments reviewed properly as that would have provided them with all the necessary information to pursue the allegations of the fraudulent transaction that i was disputing. 
In the letter dated XX/XX/2022 that I received only yesterday, it said that "" without a valid credit slip '', the provisional credit of {$1700.00} will be debited from my account and that the investigation is now closed. I called customer service with the sole intention to ask what "" valid credit slip '' meant as it may be different from what I interpret it to be and after getting a response, i intended to be transferred to the dispute department. The first representative by the name of XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who answered was mumbling her words and after deciphering that she was asking me for the name on the account for verification, I gave her my name which is the same name I have provided before to access my account. She claims that my name is not valid and that I should call again when i have the proper information. I tried to argue with her that the information provided was correct but she insisted that it was wrong and that i should call later with the correct information over and over again. How can I get my name wrong?! As I was continuing to plead my case, I finally asked for a supervisor because there was no point talking to this person. The supervisor probably wasn't aware that I could hear him telling the representative that she only needed to confirm my first and last name. He finally came on and said his name was XXXX. I asked for his identification number ' as I have started to do whenever i interacted with the CITI representatives so that I can better distinguish them from the people there who might have the same name but he refused to provide me with it even after explaining to him why I had the right to ask for it and for him to provide me with that information. He then hangs up the phone on me! I call again and as my experience has taught me, I asked for a supervisor, aware that my situation might be too complicated for the average representative and was answered by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who after hearing my complaint about the prior phone call and experience with the supervisor, filed a complaint for me and provided me with Complaint Number XXXX as its reference. XXXX and I were beginning to dissect the situation as to the validity of the bank debiting my account and closing the investigation citing that the credit slip which was being used as a reason could not be provided in the first place because that is specifically the reason why the dispute was made and that the merchant has refused to give back the money. This, to me, meant that XXXX actually read my explanation and went through the documents I sent. This is contrary to what another supervisor, named XXXX, has said after I have inquired about the meaning of a valid credit slip, he simply said that a credit slip is something that should state that the merchant is refunding the amount and without it there's nothing CITI can do regarding my dispute. I asked him what then is the purpose of disputing a charge that is considered fraudulent, sending all pertinent information, taking the time and effort to explain the situation in writing and the so called investigation you are conducting if all I had to do was get a credit slip? XXXX starts to mumble just like the very first representative i spoke with but ignores the question and presents an attitude as if he's tired of answering my questions and concerns. Unfortunately, after XXXX said that he needed to bring the subject to another colleague so that the proper corrections will be made, we were disconnected. I tried to call again to get transferred to him but the representative by the name of XXXX said that it couldn't be done. XXXX insisted that I tell him the situation and the reason for my call. I asked XXXX for his ID number and explained why since his name is especially very common but he declined to provide it and even laughed at me when I tried to persist. He even said while mocking me "" you can ask my supervisor his ID number and he MAY give it to you but I'm not going to give you mine! "". Frustrated by all this, I hung up the phone before speaking to another supervisor that I requested. I finally had a chance to speak to an XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who was pleasant enough to ask to allow him to assist me since he was with the dispute department and offer that if I should wish to, he can also connect me with another supervisor. his tone was pleasant enough that I allowed myself to explain again for the nth time the situation and he confirmed what XXXX and i had discussed regarding the credit slip and suggested that I send another letter which included the same attachments I sent the very first time as that was the proof needed and to appeal the case and to have it reopened again. He said not to worry about the {$170.00} as that has already been reopened and to just concentrate on the {$1700.00} which will be debited. I had told him that I would send the letter of appeal and just include the original letter plus the attachments with it and he said that it would be sufficient and for me to call in 48 hours to confirm that the documents submitted has been uploaded. Sadly, after everything that has been said and done, I'll believe it when it actually happens. 
My question is, with what XXXX has said, did anyone actually read and take into consideration the initial letter and the attached documents as proof that the transactions were legitimate or did the dispute department just simply rely on the 'valid credit slip ' that I could not possibly provide to make their decision? Is the Dispute Department being negligent to actually do their job of providing service for CITIbank clients and 'investigating ' the dispute with due diligence? I was on the phone trying to get some answers and correct what I perceive to be a mistake regarding the handling of my dispute for about three and a half hours yesterday and only a couple of people, out of the more than a dozen representatives and supervisors, gave me the courtesy to actually listen and address my concerns. But even then, because of the numerous contradicting information given to me, I have lost trust in your customer service and dispute department which is truly unfortunate because despite having some exceptional people in these departments, it has been marred by those that give false, incorrect, and deceptive information and additionally, the ones that would rather escalate an already sensitive situation with aggressive, arrogant, argumentative and dismissive behavior. Aside from the branch, these customer service people who answers the phone are at the forefront of representing CITIbank and if this attitude goes on without repercussion or accountability then it reflects the same attitude that the company has towards its clients.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,92804,,Consent

191405,2002560,2023-01-31,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/2022 I attempted to purchase a coffee machine from XXXX  for {$1700.00}. I immediately received a text message alert from Chase Credit Card Fraud Services asking if I was indeed trying to purchase an item from XXXX, that my transaction was blocked as a precaution, and if I was indeed trying to purchase the item I should reprocess the transaction. As I was indeed trying to purchase the item, I resubmitted the order. That day, however, I was feeling nervous about the legitimacy of XXXX Not only had I received the Chase Fraud alert, but the website misspelled, the "" contact us '' feature on the website was not functioning, the voicemail of the website 's phone number was unprofessional, and I learned the address of the website 's headquarters was in fact not a real address after searching for it on XXXX. This learning, combined with the initial Chase Fraud alert, caused me to question if I had in fact ordered this coffee machine from a legitimate merchant. As a result, I emailed the merchant and informed them I had placed two orders, only wanted one of them, and hoped I would receive an order confirmation soon. The person at this email address actually replied indicating they would only send one item and it would ship the next business day. However, the email was written in heavily broken XXXX and I had still not received an order confirmation email. As a result, I contacted Chase Fraud, informed them of the situation, and was advised to block these charges and that an investigation would follow. After some time had passed I was informed by Chase that they had contacted the merchant and that the merchant had provided a XXXX tracking number "" justifying '' they had in fact shipped me the coffee maker and that the dispute had therefore been closed. Chase provided me with the merchant 's response on XX/XX/2022. This response included the XXXX tracking number in question which showed that a package had indeed been delivered to "" a house '' ( not mine ). Interestingly, this particular tracking number had an image of the house where it was delivered and it was clearly not my house or any of my neighbors. Furthermore, the package in the tracking information had small dimensions ( 14 '' x10 '' x7 '' ) and was very light ( 4lbs ). The manufacturer of the coffee maker, however, clearly showed on their website that the coffee maker itself ( without shipping packaging ) was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was clear to me that whatever package the merchant was trying to justify had been sent to me was not only not sent to my address, but couldn't possibly have been the product I ordered. Upon re-emailing the merchant to follow up on the status of the shipment, no response could be raised. The phone number was no longer active on their website and the address of the merchant was changed to a foreign address in XXXX. Several weeks later, the website XXXX  was shutdown and listed as inactive by the hosting provider.

My intent was to refinance the current 4.9 % interest to a lower 3.1 % interest Mortgage and take {$25000.00} out for remodeling. 

My credit is excellent and have been sending all the documents required as requested in a timely manner. However, after almost seven months delay, I was transferred to a different loan officer, XXXX XXXX who apologized for the delay and promised to complete the process within weeks. A few months passed and without any notice he transferred my file back to XXXX. 

In the meantime, on XX/XX/XXXX I informed XXXX, XXXX, and the processor XXXX that I have a 0 % interest 2nd loan with XXXX XXXX and sent them the subordination request form that I received from XXXX to allow them to take a 2nd position. However, this was ignored by all of them. 

Eventually about a month ago on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX the processor contacted me to tell me the loan is in final approval stage and informed me the loan package is set up to pay off the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I made it clear to her that my intent was not to replace 0 % interest with interest bearing loan from US bank. To refresh her memory, I resend the email that I had previously sent to all of them back in XX/XX/XXXX clarifying my intentions for applying. She apologized and informed me that despite my wishes the loan was set up that way and there was nothing that could be done to change it. Despite their negligence, she suggested that I restart the application process from scratch. I then made several attempts by phone and email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX attempting get explanation why the error happened and get a better understanding of what can be done moving forward to avoid the same kind of mistake from happening. It has been almost 4 weeks ; he has decided not to respond to me directly. Instead, he keeps sending me multiple confusing applications for me to sign. 

Despite the unprecedented delay in approving the refinance and processing cost incurred as well as high interest payment for over a year, I am still being mistreated. This has certainly been a very frustrating experience. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Manager XXXX XXXX hoping offer amicable resolution. However, on XX/XX/XXXX he emailed me back saying the application was closed and his solution was to offer me the {$390.00} refund of my application fee practically denying me refinance with US Bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,MN,55446,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2021-07-27,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,4578867,1,1.0,exactli year ago appli refin current high interest mortgag xxxx xxxx us bank mortgag offic intent refin current 4 9 interest lower 3 1 interest mortgag take 25000 00 remodel credit excel send document requir request time manner howev almost seven month delay transfer differ loan offic xxxx xxxx apolog delay promis complet process within week month pass without notic transfer file back xxxx meantim xx xx xxxx inform xxxx xxxx processor xxxx 0 interest 2nd loan xxxx xxxx sent subordin request form receiv xxxx allow take 2nd posit howev ignor eventu month ago xx xx xxxx xxxx xxxx processor contact tell loan final approv stage inform loan packag set pay xxxx xxxx xxxx made clear intent replac 0 interest interest bear loan us bank refresh memori resend email previous sent back xx xx xxxx clarifi intent appli apolog inform despit wish loan set way noth could done chang despit neglig suggest restart applic process scratch made sever attempt phone email xxxx xx xx xxxx attempt get explan error happen get better understand done move forward avoid kind mistak happen almost 4 week decid respond directli instead keep send multipl confus applic sign despit unpreced delay approv refin process cost incur well high interest payment year still mistreat certainli frustrat experi xx xx xxxx contact manag xxxx xxxx hope offer amic resolut howev xx xx xxxx email back say applic close solut offer 390 00 refund applic fee practic deni refin us bank

No other credit card I deal with does this. I can set my promotional payment allocation on other card 's website so I don't have to CALL EACH MONTH to allocate my payment.

I had received notice from you stating that my complain was sent to Citizens on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from the Office of the Chairman at citizens, from the same woman ( XXXX XXXX ) I had spoken with previously, who denied my claim twice before. It stated, obviously after getting notifed by CFPB, that she was in receipt of my concern regarding a disputed transaction and that she tried to reach me by phone but was unsuccessfulI. I had not received a call, but responded by email that I wasnt sure why she was calling and to respond by email back to me as I could not reach her by phone either!! Which was part of my complaint. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from CSPB saying that the company ( Citizens ) had responded that they were still working on my claim. As far as I knew and was told by this XXXX XXXX from the Chairmans office, that my claim was denied so that was not accurate. On XX/XX/XXXX in the mail I received an envelope from Citizens Bank, in it was a blank white paper with Citizens Bank in right hand corner and the date XX/XX/XXXX and my name and address heading in the upper left hand corner. A separate piece of paper followed and it was a check for XXXX!? The top part was the non negotiable agent copy the bottom half showed an official check XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX pay XXXX to Me with my address. In the memo it said OLB Claim XXXX which is the claim I filed with them, but for XXXX, not XXXX. There was no explanation of why or what this check was for. I contacted someone from your office to see if there was any further settlement deal etc.. and was told that CFPB still had the complaint as open. This appears to be a payoff of some kind and is Not the full amount that I had lost or requested returned. Once again the communication with Citizens is horrible.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and informed them of the issue in which they told me they never received a tax statement from the county. I obtained a tax statement, and forwarded it to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX titled ( Loan # - Property Taxes Due ) and was told that it should be processed in 2 weeks. Following up 2 weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with the XXXX tax department ( Core Logic. ) During that phone call Core Logic informed me that did indeed receive a copy of the tax statement but now the issue was that the legal description on the tax statement didn't match the description on the loan, but they would get it resolved. They then Informed me to call back in 2 weeks to allow processing. XX/XX/XXXX Called the county treasures office to inform them on the issue, in which they told me that Core Logic or XXXX had never tried to reach out to them to get it resolved. Called back on XX/XX/XXXX, spoke with Core Logic again. They told me that they did eventually contact my taxing authority about getting the issue resolved and that they were going to go ahead and disperse the amount out of my escrow to prevent anymore late fees and penalties. ( Core Logic never made the disbursement ) XX/XX/XXXX I received a final notice of payment before tax sale from the County treasures office in the amount of ( {$3600.00}. ) I contacted XXXX right after I received the letter but the tax department was closed and the customer service rep didn't have any information. XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX and informed them of the letter I received. They wanted me to forward them the letter to XXXX. I forwarded them the letter along with the Tax statement, the property deed, and land survey. Was told to call back in 7 days to allow for "" expedited processing. '' Called back on XX/XX/XXXX spoke with Core Logic but was told it would take another 7 days for processing. I called Core Logic back on XX/XX/XXXX for an update. They informed me that the legal description still wasn't right. They then proceeded to verify with the county tax authority that the property description was actually correct, but it would take up to another 7 days to process. I informed them that if I wasn't able to get this simple issue resolved by the end of the day ( XXXX ) that I was going to be contacting legal council.

I may be wrong, but I FEEL like I am experiencing a very unfair situation. I went to Value City XXXX with enough cash to purchase the furniture I got that day. However, I was urged by my salesman to put it all on a credit card. I told him, I had the cash. Of course, this is a decision I made. 

I was told I would be able to pay it back with no interest as long as I paid it back within the "" Promo '' balance pay period. And that if I didn't pay it off within that time period, I would be charged interest. I was fine with that, so I signed up. What I didn't understand ( and this is my fault ), was that if I didn't pay the full balance by that time, I would incur "" RETROACTIVE '' interest ( again, probably my fault for not reading the entire slew of terms and conditions ). 

However, I continually paid more than the amount due on my account every month with your company proceeding to increase my credit limit. I never went over my limit and continually paid, on time, more than what was due. I eventually paid down about 1/3 of the bill when one of these cute little "" Promo '' balances became due. I thought oh well, Now I will need to begin to pay more because the interest will "" BEGIN '' accruing. Still unaware that I would be charged a huge amount of retroactive interest. 
When I saw the new balance, I almost had a XXXX XXXX. 

I called your company and was met with very rude, overseas, obstinate customer service. I asked a couple of them ( because I called a couple of times ) was there anything I could do. I was told that I could "" pay my bill using a bank account ''. As if I didnt know that. 

Each time I called asking if there was anything I could do to change this situation, no one would listen to me. And I definitely wasnt rude or challenging. 
I work very hard for my money, and I try to do everything to pay my bills and keep my credit right. When this lovely "" retroactive interest '' kicked in, I hadn't received a commission check in 3 months because my sales were down as an XXXX XXXX, and I had no other income. 

Since then, I have acquired two more jobs so now I have three jobs in an attempt to keep a roof over my head. I don't have a husband or family or anyone to help me with bills and now I will be paying three times what this furniture cost, which also happens to be five times what its worth, when I nearly had it paid off, on time. 

The kicker was when your company proceeded to close my account even though I was still paying, on time, which, as I'm sure you know, DINGS my credit. 

So, I signed up for your credit card I didn't need, got hit with retroactive interest, was treated like XXXX by the people that answer your phones, I still have to pay for this, AND your company decided best practices were to also close my account and DING my credit? I feel like "" predatory lending ''. 

I haven't used the credit card in about a year AND I was thrown over my limit to satisfy your retroactive interest anyway. It was tantamount to your company saying to me, "" Let 's go ahead and FINISH her ''. 

I understand my role in reading what I sign up for, but I don't understand their decision to make their final move. And believe it was very unfair and more so "" UNNECESSARY ''.

XXXX times in the last XXXX XXXX Truist has applied our payment as XXXX regular payments of {$1000.00} each which includes an extra interest payment and an extra escrow payment. This reduces our principal reduction by the total of XXXX extra interest and escrow payment. I have called Truist many times to get these extra {$1000.00} payments reapplied. They have corrected XXXX of the XXXX. I have called Truist at least XXXX times over the last XXXXXXXX XXXX to get these extra payment reapplied. Each time I talk to them I ask that they put a note in my file indicating that all excess be applied to principal reduction. They have stated several times that my file is so annotated. 

They have not corrected the XX/XX/2022 payment. Truist received my payment of {$4000.00} on XX/XX/2022 They applied this as XXXX regular payments of {$1000.00} with an additional escrow reduction of {$1900.00}. Truist should have applied my {$4000.00} as XXXX regular payment of {$1000.00} and an additional principal reduction payment of {$3000.00}. 

I called Truist in early XX/XX/2022 and asked that they correctly apply the payments I had made in XX/XX/2022 and in XX/XX/2022. They said that this would be done. They did correct the XXXX payment which lowered my mortgage balance by {$760.00}. They did not make any changes to the XXXX payment. 

I did not notice that the XXXX payment had not been corrected. I next contacted Truist in XXXX and asked that they correctly apply the XXXX payment. They did so and my mortgage balance decreased by {$730.00}. 

I next contacted Truist on XX/XX/2022 and asked that they correctly apply the payment of {$3000.00} that they had received the previous day on XX/XX/XXXX. I also asked that they correct the XXXX payment that they had previously told me would be corrected and which had not. They told me that both the XXXX and the XXXX payments would be corrected on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX payment was corrected and again my mortgage balance decreased by over {$700.00}. The XXXX payment was not corrected. 

I next called Truist on XX/XX/XXXX and asked that the XXXX payment be corrected. I was told that this correction had been denied. 

I next wrote a NOTICE OF ERROR letter to Truist on XX/XX/XXXX explaining everything that had been going on for many XXXX. I demanded that they immediately correct the XXXX payment. I received Truist 's response letter dated XX/XX/2022. Truist 's response did not even address the XXXX payment. They instead addressed the XXXX payment that had been corrected on XX/XX/2022 in response to my phone call at that time. 

In XXXX of my conversations with Truist employees in an attempt to have these corrections made, the employee told me that this is fleecing. If the XXXX payment is corrected it will lower my mortgage balance by {$750.00}. I need help getting this XXXX payment corrected and I want Truist to stop "" fleecing '' ( a Truist employee 's word ) my mortgage account.

Fraudulent XXXX purchases totaling {$6900.00} on our Costco Anywhere Visa were detected by the Citi system XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately responded by disputing the charges and the card was closed. 

XXXX issued partial credits of {$5800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. However, reverse charges issued by Citi on XX/XX/XXXX totaled {$8800.00}. The result is a difference of {$2800.00} between the credits and the reversed charges. Several of the XX/XX/XXXX reverse charges appear to have been applied incorrectly ; for example, there are three reverse charges of three different amounts all with the same ID.

112690,2125450,2021-07-14,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/2021, I fell victim to a fraud scheme perpetrated by a criminal group posing as a customer service department from XXXX, XXXX. I had returned merchandise purchased via the XXXX website approximately one month earlier to XXXX. The XXXX webpage at the time did not post a customer service phone number so I had to do a XXXX Search to find a Customer Service number to check on my refund of {$250.00}. The number that appeared at the top of the list referred to XXXX Customer Service, so I called that number. It turned out to be completely fraudulent but the man answering my call, said Hello This is XXXX from Customer Service, how can I help you. I explained I had not received my refund which was overdue. He said he would get me my refund that day. He asked me to download several cell phone apps which I did and then sent me several code numbers to authorize an electronic funds transfer. After about 45 minutes of being on the phone he said I should see my refund in my account. When I checked about 20 minutes after the call ended, I found 13 fraudulent debit card pulls from my account totaling over {$6200.00}. I immediately called and asked why he had done this? He said it is temporary and asked me to again authorize additional transfers. At this point I realized this was a scam, hung up and called the local police department. I filed a police fraud/theft report # XXXX with Deputy XXXX of the XXXX, CA Sheriffs/Police office. 

I then went to my Union Bank branch and filed a fraud report and closed the account that had been attacked. I opened a new separate account which would not allow any further access. I was told by the branch manager and the personal banker that the bank would provide a provisional credit of the funds taken from me fraudulently within 10 days of the incident pending the outcome of a bank investigation. 
This conflicted with what I was told by the financial fraud unit after being contacted by them in the process of the Union Bank investigation. At first, they said I would get a provisional refund on or around XX/XX/XXXX which was 10 days after the filing. When I did not see that credit, I called again, and they said that there will be no provisional credit at all due to this being a Mastercard Debit purchase. I explained this was all fraudulent and that I had filed a police report and an additional IC-3 Federal Crime report. 

I eventually received a letter from Union Bank stating that my claim had been denied due to my authorization of the use of my debit card for what appeared to be purchases. I received no product or service and was not the one benefitting from the withdrawal of my funds. I was further told by Union Bank that Mastercard was now investigating and may be able to recover my funds if it is found to be fraudulent and that I did not receive merchandise or service as a result of the use of my debit card. 

I feel very disappointed in Union Banks Policy not to even grant me a provisional credit due to this fraud perpetrated by unscrupulous individuals posing as actual customer service reps. I am XXXX  years of age and I feel I have been victimized not only by the perpetrators of this scheme but also by my own bank that I have been a customer of for over 20 years. I feel that in the end Mastercard will find that this was a financial crime scheme which used Mastercard and a company called XXXX XXXX  to illegally withdraw funds from my bank account. I am requesting an investigation into Policies and Procedures of Union Bank in recovering my funds and protecting customers from these scams.

138647,48461,2022-02-19,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"( Please see attachments for formatted version of this description ) -- -- -On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by my parents that they had received a credit card ( Forever 21 card issued by Comenity Capital bank ) at their address in my name, which also came with a first bill with charges totaling {$490.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX at the Forever 21 shop in XXXX  XXXX XXXX IL XXXX The statement closing date was XX/XX/XXXX with payment due data of XX/XX/XXXX. 


I was not aware of this card nor did I make the charges. I live and work in the XXXX since XXXX where I also have a family and own a house. I was not present in the US at the time this card was opened or when the charges were made. 


I immediately contacted Comenity Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and informed them that I did not open this card and that I dont live at that address and was not present in the US when these charges were made, and that I had been the victim of identity fraud. I wanted the account and liability immediately removed from my name. The representative on the phone said this appeared to be a clear case of fraud and the account would be removed from my name and transferred to their fraud department for further handling. I was led to believe that no further action was needed from me. 

Meanwhile I also contacted XXXX and put a hold on my credit and a fraud alert and opened a dispute against the fraudulent card. Through XXXX I discovered that the person who stole my identity and opened this card fraudulently used an old phone number for me ( which has not been in service for some years ). The address as well is that of my parents instead of my current address. On XXXX XXXX I filed my first complaint with the CFPB and on XXXX XXXX with the local police department where the fraudulent charges were made ( XXXX XXXX, IL ). Recently, on XX/XX/XXXX I have also filed a report of Identity Theft with the FTC. 


Through my earlier CFPB complaint I received the finding from Comenity that Our Account Protection ( Fraud ) team completed the fraud investigation and found no basis to support the fraud claim. As of the date of this letter, the balance on the account is {$490.00}. You are responsible for this balance. We reviewed the applicable telephone calls. We werent able to locate any instances where our representative agreed the account was fraudulent and/or advised the account would be removed from your credit file. 

I categorically and fully contest every part of the companys response to my complaint and it is clear they have not given this a conscientious or thorough review. They have apparently not taken into account that I do not live in the US nor was present when this credit card was opened and used in a physical store location, as I reported in my first and only conversation with Comenity on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not, and still have not provided me with clear or correct information regarding the process ( like the fact that apparently there is a full burden of proof is on me ), that I needed to prompt further investigation, or that I needed to supply specific evidence. Moreover, their fraud line representative misled me into believing this was going to be handled as a fraudulent account without further action needed from me ( though they apparently do not find in the call recordings that this conversation took place, though I only spoke to one representative by the time I filed the CFPB report ). They have not provided me with complete info about the account and opening of the card that I can contest with evidence, for example precisely when/where the card was opened. Based on the statement dates and activity I assume this was opened at the Forever 21 shop in XXXX XXXX, IL at some time in XX/XX/XXXX, and therefore the evidence I supply here is based on that assumption and the two known transaction dates of XXXX XXXX XXXX at the physical Forever 21 shop in XXXX XXXX  XXXX IL. 


I insist that Comenity now once and for all and completely remove this account and liability from my name and credit report. To support this I provide additional evidence here, specifically around the fact that I live in the XXXX, not at the address used to fraudulently open the card, and I was not physically present in the US at the time the card was opened and charges made at a physical store location in IL. If this is not sufficient for Comenity I ask them to inform me specifically what evidence they are expecting from me. 


I attached the following information in support of my request, and can submit additional pieces of evidence if Comenity provides me more information about how/where/when the card was initially opened or informs me of what specific pieces of evidence they are looking for. 
- a copy of my full passport showing that I was only present in the US in 2021 from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ( in two parts to keep to under the 10MB limit ) -corresponding copies of boarding passes for those flights -a copy of my XXXX ( XXXX ) residency permit, showing that I am a resident here -a copy of my XXXX ( XXXX ) drivers license -a copy of my local XXXX insurance policies via my bank here, XXXX XXXX, including the XXXX XXXX '' or personal liability insurance showing it is active since I moved to the XXXX in XXXX and showing my current address in The XXXX -A copy of my official US economic stimulus payments to me at my current address in The XXXX, proving that this is the address I use for filing my US taxes and is formally recognized by the US. 
-A copy of a dental bill to me at my current address in the XXXX showing that I was present in the XXXX during XX/XX/XXXX. 
-A copy of my local tax bill showing that I am the owner of the house in The XXXX in XXXX -A copy of the first page of the transfer of the deed to the house in the XXXX in XXXX, proving that I own this house since XXXX -A ( partially redacted ) copy of my payslip from XX/XX/XXXX showing that I am employed locally in the XXXX with this company since XXXX, and showing my current address in the XXXX. 
-A copy of the police report I filed with the XXXX  XXXX Police Dept in XX/XX/XXXX -A copy of my FTC Identity Theft report Note : Throughout the entire process it has been nearly impossible to file complaints or get my credit information as I am blocked from all credit bureaus when trying to access their sites from a non-US IP address, most activities require setting up an account with a US phone number for receiving activation or authentication codes. For example, filing the police report was difficult because the normal process is to have an officer call you back when they are available to take down the report but they can only call US phone numbers. And the police report needs a local US address and US phone number. Even the FTC site is essentially impossible to use from a non-US IP address, does not accept international phone numbers. Filing this report took me an extra month to do than should have been needed and I needed to have a family member go through the online process locally in the US and file on my behalf.

120854,325759,2021-09-27,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Dear Sir or Madam, 1. DSNB MACYS Account XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in December XXXX as well as 60 days late payment on January XX/XX/XXXX. 


I immediately disputed this information with DSNB MACYS and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the late with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

197827,663279,2023-03-05,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,You never received your bill or did not know a payment was due,"I have several credit cards, some of which are with Bank of America. ALL of my credit cards, mortgage, utilities, subscriptions, etc. are always set up with auto pay as a safety net and to protect my credit rating. I pay extremely close attention to the charges that appear on credit cards and typically carry a {$0.00} balance. My credit card use averages 6 % and under. 

In XXXX, 2023 I received a notice from Bank of America that my payment was late. When I spoke with a representative from Bank of America, they reviewed my account and could not determine how my auto pay was removed from that account as it was still active on the other accounts. He offered to remove any late fees, of which there were none to remove. The bill was for a {$75.00} annual fee with a few dollars of interest. I had immediately paid off the balance and asked the Bank ensure this late payment is NOT reported to the credit bureaus. I was told they couldn't do that but that I should contact the bureaus and ask to have it removed if it showed up. It showed up! I filed formal requests with each credit reporting agency. Two have turned it down saying the reporting is accurate. 

Auto pay was set up in an effort to protect me and my credit in the event there is ever a time when I am unable to manage my finances. In XXXX I suffered a major XXXX due to a XXXX XXXX and under went XXXX XXXX. I was not able to manage my credit cards or bill payments but was not worried. I knew that the autopay was in effect and left me feeling confident that if a payment became due, it would be paid. I have the medical records and bills exceeding $ XXXX to prove this incident occurred. 

My question for Bank of America is how, AND WHY, did they remove my auto pay. The representative reported it as having been a computer error and verified that I had set up the autopayment feature on my account. Why wasn't the payment processed? How is this "" computer error '' MY issue? Why am I suffering a drop in my credit score due to an error at this institution? Why isn't the issue reviewed and resolved by a human being rather than automated correspondence? If autopay is randomly deleted and can not be trusted, why is is an offered feature of the bank for their credit card payments? 

I want this entry removed from my payment history. I want my excellent credit score, which exceeded XXXX, to be re-established. This is a {$75.00} fee that while I understand it's part of the credit card agreement, I did not initiate the charges and due to my medical emergency was not able to monitor the activities on a card that should not have required monitoring. 

I wrote letters to the Comptroller of the Currency asking for assistance. All correspondence to Bank of America, Comptroller of the Currency and the three credit bureaus was sent Certified US Postal Service. I have contacted Bank of America by phone.

XXXX XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX caused extreme damage through flooding. To prevent mold wet drywall had to be removed immediately. 

Unable to get response from general contractors to work on my thousand-square-foot, XXXX home, with the help of my family and friends the house was dried out in time. Work repairing damage continued with me as homeowner acting as my own general contractor with tremendous help from my family. 

A flood claim was filed, {$20000.00} advance was received from FEMA within days. The endorsed check was sent to Finance of America where funds were withheld for weeks.

Denied the use of the {$20000.00} advance in making repairs, I borrowed on my mortgage, thereby incurring interest and fees. And I continued to borrow as repair expenses mounted.

The balance of claim {$74000.00} was sent by FEMA to me XX/XX/XXXX. I sent the endorsed check to Finance of America. Scanned receipts of expenses in two batches totaling over {$60000.00} have been sent to Finance of America. Two days ago I received release of funds {$27000.00}, {$47000.00} being withheld.

In my obligation to maintain my home in good repair, I have had to borrow thousands, after having paid for flood insurance, my claim having been honored by FEMA, incurring interest and fees while Finance of America keeps my funds.

165067,105244,2022-09-01,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"This is my second complaint about US Bank Mortgaging. Please refer to my original complaint for a more detailed history of events XXXX. My most recent complaint is about US Banks practices with applying payments to my mortgage, their communication and the fact that they have proven to be negligent with my mortgage account. 



In XXXX I applied for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was granted funding on my account to cover me for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX by a non profit organization called XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, HUD Certified Housing Counselor XXXX approved my assistance on XX/XX/2022. 



XXXX has confirmed that all payments have been made to US Bank and that the payments prior to the XXXX payment have been cashed and notated on the organizations accountings ledger. US Bank claims they have not received payment. 





I contacted USBank approximately XX/XX/XXXX to find out the status of the payment as I continue to receive calls about the account being past due. I asked that they research the payment As XXXX XXXX confirmed that the payments had been cashed. On XX/XX/2022 XXXX XXXX and I contacted the bank together to get a better understanding as far as why the bank has cashed the checks but has not applied the payments. The Customer service rep contacted a relationship manager in loss mitigation and stated that she sees the account is in system processing status. 



My account has been in system processing status since XX/XX/2022 and I have not received answers. She then stated that she seen my loan modification was under review and thats where the disconnect on the payment issue was. I explained to the Customer service Rep my loan modification was completed XX/XX/2022. As I have documentation from US Bank showing. I stated that I was told by multiple agents that no payment from XXXX XXXX were to be made on the account as various payments were made to the account in the month of XXXX. 



The XXXX statement that I received from USbank reflected that the next payment due was in XXXX in the amount of XXXX. This is when XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paying the 3 months of payments that were approved from her organization. 



The issues I have, is that USbank has cashed these checks but has failed to apply payments to my account which has negatively impacted my loan, and now my credit. I am incurring late fees. 


US Bank sends me a new 1098 tax form every month with different amounts. I have already completed my taxes and now I have to amend my return. I have so many forms 1098 tax forms that I can not ammend my return as I dont know which one is valid USbank received {$12000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which would then bring my account current this was for all the payments I fell behind due to COVID-19. I was told by customer service reps that the modification would no longer be valid as that money would make my account current as of today with the exception of the newly lost payments that were applied for XXXX and XXXX. 



USBank has not updated the total balance of my loan to reflect any of the payments made. If there is no longer a modification why would I still owe what is listed on the modification agreement {$170000.00}? If the account is current. The XXXX does not reflect in the total balance instead USbank has kept the total balance the same as what was notated on the modification although the modification is no longer valid since the account is current. 

US Bank had already caused issues by closing out my modification without cause, and have admitted fault. US Bank has already wrongfully started foreclosures in the past which they deny which lead to the home being destroyed due to their negligence as they forced us to move out then later offered a mortgage payment.

129711,1017457,2021-12-11,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"called the CFPB today to make sure a note was entered & submitted to Capital One with this claim. which is Claim ID XXXX, I submitted on XX/XX/2021. Reason being is that I will have to spend all weekend, my weekend writing step by step, date, times & all documentation I have of everything that took place since the OCC submitted another one that wasnt even sufficient as I was talking to them about other issues while asking questions about this serious complaint. Im not sure why it was submitted to capital one in that format but when I spoke to them on the phone this week they let me know they sent a portion to the CFPB to be sent to capital one which is was & point is neither here nor there, this is what I am/ have submitted and working on it so at this time until I have all documents uploaded and all written and perhaps notarized documents capital one has nothing to even reply to to this at this point, I mean clearly go ahead but makes sense to wait until I have added all to this. In the meantime this is also to state that my account is sitting negative, overdraft charges have been added and an auto pay to XXXX  that comes out each month was denied and I got an email stating that since I have Insufficient funds they were not able to approved a purchase I made. I didnt make a purchase, please I already made XXXX aware to try and take my auto pay off but they didnt have time and I made capital one aware what this does to my perfect history with XXXX of 25 years. Never once missed a payment. 


Again, since capital one has chosen to continue to lie and avoid all of this and wont contact me back as I was promised I now have to spend tonight and all weekend completing this. So very disturbing and concerning. Lastly, I have spoken to several places that I needed to get specific details regarding this investigation so while I never intended to go this route since this has turned in to a handful of things which stems from capital one not handling from the beginning accurately this is now what I have to do and they will have to answer each question I have asked them for the last 3 weeks or more actually via this method. 

To make it clear while I am working on this, Capital one sent me one email the day I wrote back stating this is my last attempt and will be going a different route and it said nothing of substance of one thing related to any of this, didnt send me the email they promised me and told me they sent twice or three times actually and never did so I am making it known here that I believe that email was due to all the escalation emails I sent to their corporate offices whom never did a thing, and stated to call them. Sorry but at the last hour, after 11 calls, I should call them again and go through the nightmare hour plus calls to a call center and be told this was opened and is being escalated and they cant believe this is happening to me and I will be getting another provisional credit and I will ne hearing back within 2-5 days? I did three of those and never heard a word. They 100 % should have called me, I am the customer and there is a severe issue that is sitting here not being addressed and I have done everything possible and they have done nothing but lie and ignore this. What is this? Its avoiding and truly there is a serious customer issue that I stated I need addressed regardless the outcome I would be addressing once I hear and see all I was told was sent to me and to be provided but they didnt and lied about 7 serious things. 

Thank you for the patience.

I have done my own investigation/case study and have researched numerus legal cases in which other consumers were victims of the same things that I am now experiencing, and the courts have ruled each an every time that the credit reporting agency could not merely parrot information from the creditors and/or collection agencies.

It took several months before Grain unlocked my account so I could change the bank account and subsequently have my credit file updated to remove late payments ( which I sincerely appreciate ) due to the support issues. After I updated my bank account, I was able to make a payment to bring the account current and Grain began making their automatic withdrawals.

I spoke to several agents online, and they informed me that there was a {$480.00} balance that had to be paid first before they unlocked our phones. I paid the balance right then, as I was talking to them in an online chat, and they confirmed my account was now {$0.00} and that it would take 24 hours to unlock our phones and they would be unlocked and ready to use with a new SIM card the next day. 

I SPECIFICALLY verified with them that both my and my husband 's phones would be unlocked and ready to go, and someone claiming to be a supervisor confirmed. 

The next day, neither phone was unlocked, so I engaged with them again. This time they SPECIFICALLY confirmed that my account balance was {$0.00} and that my account was canceled. This was in chat, so they should have a transcript. They apologized profusely, and since I needed my phone for work, they this time successfully unlocked it. 

The problem was that they did not unlock my husband 's phone, even though I specifically asked whether the account was closed for both phones and so I had to engage with them again. But during that conversation, they once again confirmed that I paid everything that needed to be paid. 

In none of those conversations was anything mentioned about an extra balance, or even the possibility of us owing any more money. They SPECIFICALLY confirmed in conversation 2 of 3 that my balance was {$0.00}. Then they began sending emails demanding {$360.00}. I called to find out what was going on and why they were claiming I had a balance even though they confirmed there was no balance, the account was closed, and that no more money was owed without informing me of any kind of possibility of extra charges.

I called in to XXXX  ( representing USAA bank ) in XXXX investigating the process to migrate to a deferall. The guy on call sorta jumped the gun and submitted me for the deferral before end of call once realized what he had done I freaked out and he cancelled it and was supposed to have a manager call me. I forget exactly the sequence after then if the deferall was properly cancelled or I was recorded as late cause didn't comply with, the logic was why come out till firmer on financial footing and was allowed 12 months. Anyway, In say XXXX or so I called raising XXXX and got to speak to manager or supervisor that seemed like they have it under wraps and would be able to pursue the deferral. I then actually even did another loan after that and during that process ( XXXX ) called in to discuss and came up again and was under impressions would be able to do deferral and to just start making payments in XXXX. I did this. My payment was rejected by XXXX and returned. I then received a note I had been approved for a mortgage modification. I only wanted the deferral. i don't want my credit damaged and my understanding was that during the Covid Forbearance there was not interest acruing on the missed payments. I basically want to do the deferral to protect my credit and think I should not pay extra interest penalties/ due to modication, but they actually increased my principal balance like XXXX. I have called into XX/XX/XXXXand had 3 requests for manager to call me back but have gotten none. One from XXXX and two recently. I fell like this is just going to go into foreclosure before they ever respond.

I was trouble receiving my mail ( Post office issues ) and asked XXXX to reissue the checks originally sent to me. When XXXX reissued and mailed the replacement checks, it seems I received the cancelled checks as well as the replacement checks at the same time but I was not aware til I made my deposit. The replaced checks were returned and Capitol One froze my account. 

When I called customer service to see why my account was frozen they had me speak to the XXXX XXXX. I asked them to clarify why they had my account frozen but they refused and told me they couldnt answer any questions. They were very rude to me, and questioning me as if I was a criminal who deposited fake checks. I told them this was XXXX public assistance checks and asked them to please release my account as this was to assist with a hardship I was having. The agent continued to question me, asked me the address of my center, my case worker, what the check was for and asked for a contact number with an agent at the center to verify my case. All govt agencies were shut down because of the Pandemic so at the time the only way to communicate with XXXX was through email and a general number which only rang busy. When I explained this to Capitol One they told me they couldnt help me and they would keep my account frozen and the rude agent hung up on me without ever explaining why my account was frozen. 

I called back to complain with a supervisor who explained to me it was because some of my deposits were returned but once fully cleared funds would be released to me. Its been a year and half, funds were cleared then but my account remains frozen with no explanation why. 

Ive called the bank NUMEROUS times and even told them I was exempt from this act as it was Public Assistance. I received a letter telling me my account was closed around XX/XX/2020. I was advised by someone that once a bank closes an account by law theyre suppose to release funds. The bank never did and my account to date remains frozen and gains a few pennies in interest monthly. 

During my last call to them 2 months ago, the agent told me they would confirm the clearance of funds, why? I dont understand, and mail a check for my balance to me. They never did. They never sent me anything in writing confirming an update or response to my requests.

XXXX XXXX XXXX ReferenceXXXX ; and Notice of Intent to Sue for racket, identity theft and other misconduct.

Dear Sir/Madam, This letter is being sent to you in response to a notice sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX and your attempt to collect the debt which I previously disputed XXXX ( XXXX ) times with the creditor and their prior collectors from on XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
None of them ever responded to my lawful requests to validate the debt or identify the actual creditor who most likely is not XXXX XXXX if they used securitization of their medical accounts receivables. I have letters from various collectors who fail to identify their relationship to me purported debt and the purported creditor. It is not a secret that healthcare providers aggregate their accounts receivable into pools to sell these pools to investors. Thus, even IF I had any legitimate debt with XXXX XXXX, they already sold it for profits to non-disclosed parties using my private information as a collateral, received substantial profits and now seek additional revenue from me, in unlawful manner. 
It is also not a secret that healthcare providers intentionally overprice their services and sell unnecessary services to patients without obtaining their written consent - to overstate their accounts receivable for investors, thus sell them for more money. Most likely XXXX XXXX owes ME money for my undisclosed participation in their securitization scheme and must disclose me that they are doing with my personal information and my medical records. I never received any disclosures from XXXX XXXX regarding their intent to securitize my data even though XXXX  has many filings with SEC evidencing that they regularly issue and sell securities obviously backed by their patients identities, without ANY disclosures to patients about the sales, which is commonly known as identity theft. 
Be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. Please be also advised that I plan to proceed with a legal action against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, for medical malpractices and violation of numerous State and Federal laws, and all information from your bureau will be used for these purposes. 
This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.

Please provide me with the following : Please disclose if XXXX XXXX is engaged in securitization scheme and sells their accounts receivables or any debt to any other third parties. Please list all parties to whom such accounts receivables or debt are sold ; as well as list ALL my information which was sold or otherwise transferred by XXXX XXXX to any third parties. 

Please identify REVCO Solutions relationship to my debt and how REVCO became a collector for XXXX. Provide me copies of any retainer agreements with XXXX to verify that REVCO was lawfully hired ; or any purchase agreement where REVCO paid any money for this debt. Please state the name of XXXX XXXX represetntives who is responsible for collection and administration of accounts receivable who can provide me written proof that REVCO is actually hired by XXXX XXXX ; and explain me their securitization scheme as well as profits they received from trading my identity on the open markets and with whom. 

State what the money you say I owe is for. Please provide me a copy of my written informed consent to conduct tests and services ( XXXX  in XXXX  room ) for EACH procedure, including ultrasound and XXXX  scan ; ( 3 ) proof that the results of these tests were delivered to me and to my doctors in XXXX XXXX XXXX when requested. 
Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe. Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe ; Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state. Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX or XXXX  XXXX this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ; Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ; Defamation of Character.

If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof. 

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS.

It would be advisable that you assure that your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose. 

Best Regards, XXXX XXXX. 




































Summary of Disagreement and Disputed Charges.

1. Disputed Charge for XXXX XXXX {$1500.00}. 

I visited my family in XXXX MI when I noticed XXXX XXXX on my skin. I called to the local hospital in XXXX MI to ask if I can take a simple XXXX  test to identify the problem. The customer service desk responded that since I am not the MI resident, I have to take the blood test through the XXXX XXXX. 

Here was no emergency in any kind, I only needed a test and nobody told me that the admission for XXXX  XXXX will cost {$1500.00}, once again, just to take a general XXXX  TEST which typically cost about {$80.00}. 

I consider admission into emergency room for a non-emergency situation without a mandatory price disclosure as unnecessary and deceptive ; and dispute {$1500.00}. Bear to repeat, nobody disclosed me the cost of emergency room admission even though I specifically told the receptionist that I ONLY need the blood test. I request XXXX XXXX to remove {$1500.00} from my bill.

2. Disputed Charge for Other Imaging Services ( XXXX ) {$510.00}. 

After I was admitted to XXXX XXXX ( again, on non-emergency basis ) and a nurse took my XXXX  test, it turned back with XXXX  level XXXX without any other abnormalities. According to all medical standards, this level of XXXX  is considered as NORMAL for adults. Nonetheless, the emergency room doctor started to scare me about my dangerous condition to convince to take an XXXX  test. 

As an average person who is not familiar how much XXXX  is considered dangerous I was very scared, especially when the nurse continued to tell me that I probably have an XXXX XXXX  ( I had not ). This scary tactic to push patients to buy expensive and unnecessary for XXXX XXXX  services ( which is evident from other customers reviews of XXXX XXXX XXXX looks more like a medical malpractice rather than a treatment. 

When I asked about necessity of ultrasound and for the price, doctor said that she does not know how much it costs but because my hemoglobin is critical ( which was not true, it was NORMAL ) and they need to see that is going on with my XXXX, which was again absolutely unnecessary procedure for an emergency room who does not and did not provided me any treatment except referred me to a local hospital. The doctor then said that XXXX XXXX is cheaper than XXXX  scan, cost of which she did not know either. The financial specialist who came later also did not provide me the cost of the procedure even though I specifically asked. 

Of course I was scared when the doctor said that my condition is critical ( which was not XXXX to agreed to take XXXX  test under pressure and fear. I dispute this test this XXXX XXXX test which was ( 1 ) unnecessary in my situation because my condition was not critical ; ( 2 ) even IF I had any stones in XXXX ( I had not ), emergency room does not provide treatments but merely referred me to my local hospital in XXXX ; ( 3 ) without disclosures about the price of this procedure ; ( 4 ) did not provided me with final results of this test ; ( 4 ) did not send results to my local hospital in XXXX although they specifically requested them. I had to take the same test again and was billed twice for the same procedure because XXXX XXXX did not send the test results to XXXX XXXX XXXX who requested them. 

As the result, I had to ( XXXX ) take unnecessary test in XXXX XXXX room under pressure while the doctor knew that my XXXX  level is NORMAL ; and all that she did - referred me for tests in the local hospital ; ( 2 ) I never obtained the results of this test and had to take it again which doubled my medical bill. 

Therefore, I dispute {$510.00} charge for unnecessary ultrasound results of which were not provided to me as of today ; and request to remove this charge from my bill.

3. Disputed Charge for XXXX  Scan {$3100.00} and Pharmacy {$47.00} and {$23.00} After my ultrasound test did not show any abnormalities, the emergency room doctor started to push me to take another, more expensive CT scan which bear to repeat was absolutely unnecessary procedure for the emergency room ; and the results of which were never provided to me or my doctor in XXXX, so I had to take it again. 

Again, I was scared about my emergency condition with XXXX level of XXXX  ; and the doctor was very pushy and persistent that she needs to see that is going on with my XXXX ( and again, the emergency room doctor does not provided me any treatment for the condition which was not an emergency, she merely referred me to a hospital in XXXX. 

I repeatedly asked how much this XXXX  scan will cost and the doctor, the nurse and the financial advisor said they have NO idea, something over a thousand. Which was not true since as professionals who continuously work in the hospital, they MUST know how much their services cost ; and inform patients about the price before that force them to take it. 

As the result, the XXXX  scan came as a monster charge {$3100.00}, absolutely unnecessary in the emergency room. When I went to see a doctor in XXXX, they requested the results from XXXX XXXX which were never provided. As the result, I had to take the same test in XXXX, which not only doubled my medical bill but unnecessary exposed me to double level of XXXX and contrast medication, which is again looks more like a medical malpractice than service. 

Therefore, I dispute {$3100.00} XXXX Scan charge as dangerous and unnecessary while the results of which were not provided to me as of today ; and request to remove this charge from my bill.

4. Disputed Charge for Laboratory General Classification - {$750.00} I must repeat that my visit to XXXX XXXX was merely to take a simple blood test which is normally cost about {$80.00}. I was not aware that in order to take this test in XXXX I have to be admitted into an emergency while here was no emergency at all ; and nobody disclosed me the price of admission. 

The test came back NORMAL, with XXXX  XXXX, thus, at this point the personnel should release me home with the referral to my local hospital in XXXX. They didnt. To the contrary, the doctor used my fear to push me to take unnecessary and highly overpriced services which ( 1 ) showed NO abnormality ; ( 2 ) results were never provided to me or to my doctor in XXXX. 

At the very end the doctor decided to take a XXXX  test for XXXX the results of which I do not have at all. I was told that IF the lab will found anything wrong, someone will call me. If nobody called it means that my results are normal. I never received any calls regarding these results ; and again, when I went to XXXX, my doctor ASKED me for copies of my results in XXXX and even requested them through the hospital but nobody provided them to me or to my doctor, so I had to take all tests again. Now XXXX XXXX wants me to pay {$750.00} for tests results of which I do not even know. No need to repeat, nobody disclosed me the price for these tests. 

My bill from XXXX XXXX does not itemize Laboratory Tests ; ( which once again I consider as deceptive since nobody informed me how much XXXX test will cost, the doctor merely used scary tactics to push me to buy them ) Therefore, I dispute {$750.00} charge as unnecessary and because the results of which were not provided to me as of today ; and request to remove this charge from my bill. I agree to pay for the regular blood test, which was the reason why I visited XXXX XXXX. Please remove unnecessary charges and adjust my bill accordingly. 

It appears to be XXXX XXXX modus operandi practices to conceal from patients mandatory information which must be disclosed to obtain an INFORMED consent about the needed procedures. 

Bear to repeat, first, nobody told me that in order to take a simple blood test I have to be admitted in an emergency room with about {$1700.00} bill while my situation was not an emergency. We merely came to take a XXXX  TEST. 

Next, nobody informed me that my blood XXXX  rate of XXXX is a SAFE level. To the contrary, your doctors used scary tactics about internal bleeding ( which was not true ) to force us to take very expensive tests since I was confident I will die right in the emergency room if these tests are not taken. 

I do not recall if I gave any written consent to conduct these tests either, as well as I never received a written disclosures regarding my condition and why doctors forced me to take expensive tests on the emergency basis instead of referring me to a local Hospital in XXXX. 

I never received any disclosures about the COSTS of these procedures either since neither your doctor or even financial adviser apparently didnt know how much they will cost. 

I never received ANY test results for which you try to bill me ; I never received ANY results of review you purportedly conducted again, without informing me about results.

I agree to pay for ( 1 ) regular XXXX  test ; ( 2 ) XXXX blood test since these are ONLY two services I requested from XXXX. All others were force placed by using scary tactics ; were not necessary at the moment. The results of these tests were never provided to me or to my doctors in XXXX yet XXXX and XXXX XXXX want me to pay for services which bear to repeat were not necessary and not given to me. 

I doubt if you pay for a merchandise which a company fails to send you. 

After that XXXX XXXX XXXX whose doctors insisted that my situation is very critical and need immediate tests ) failed to provide these tests to doctors in XXXX XXXX who requested them several time! Obviously, this scary tactic was only used to push me under unnecessary expenses while I never got any results of these tests Now you informed me about some review of my case the results of which were once again are not provided and not attached to your letter. 

We found XXXX hospitals practices as a violation of my patients rights to make an INFORMED decision, get RESULTS of the test for which you charged me on timely manner ( now I have a duplicate bill for the same tests in XXXX XXXX which would be unnecessary if XXXX would send my prior tests to XXXX XXXX after they requested them several times. You did not answer why XXXX failed to provide me results to XXXX. 

Please find this Notice of Disagreement with billing charges for account XXXX ; and request to remove unnecessary, overpriced and deceptive charges for services costs of which were never provided to me ; as well as the results of which neither I or my doctor in XXXX never received since they were never provided although requested. I had to take all the same tests again, including labs and XXXX XXXX, which doubled my medical bills and put me under unnecessary and dangerous double exposure to XXXX and contrast medications. 

This is not a refusal to pay but a Notice of Disagreement with overpriced and unnecessary services which XXXX XXXX already SOLD to investors and received a substantial profit by trading my identity on

After all the paperwork had been submitted ( sometimes twice ) they moved from XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX which required more information further delaying the process. During this time the interest rate dropped to 2.5 % and per the XXXX  policy, if the consumer contacts them to acknowledge the drop in interest rate, XXXX  is obligated to lock in the lower rate. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX I contacted one of the people working on my loan to alert them of the lower rate and on their recorded line, they confirmed that they my rate was now locked at 2.5 %. I either spoke to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX all of whom were working on my loan. The only thing left was to complete an appraisal on my home which was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. During this time interest rates began to increase once again, currently at 2.875 % The appraisal was conducted on schedule completing XXXX requirements. A few days later I was contacted by XXXX XXXX who told me that XXXX XXXX had been sold to Guaranteed Rate out of XXXX IL. and that there was a chance that I may lose the 2.5 % interest rate that XXXX  had previously committed to on a recorded phone line. I was asked to wait for a week while they sort things out which I did. When I reached back out XXXX XXXX to ask what was going to happen he told me that Guaranteed Rate would NOT hold the interest rate that XXXX  had previously committed to and that it would be at the new higher rate. 
I find this to be a breach of verbal contract. I've submitted everything that they required of me in good faith in return for a financial product that they committed to prior to the change of ownership of their company. The obvious solution during a transfer of ownership would be to honor any applications in process, especially those that have nearly been completed and go forward with current market conditions thereafter. 
As a consumer, we are required to sign all sorts of legal binding documents that protect the lender but where are our protections as a consumer when it comes to commitments made to us.
